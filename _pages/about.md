Chatbot Arena is an open-source platform for evaluating large language models by human preference, developed by researchers from UC Berkeley [SkyLab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) and [LMSYS](https://lmsys.org). Join us at [lmarena.ai](https://lmarena.ai) to vote for your top models and contribute to the live leaderboard!

We always welcome contributions from the community. If you're interested in getting involved, we'd love to hear from you!
