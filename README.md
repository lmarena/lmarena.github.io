## Dev workflow

Install ruby and bundle:

```
conda install -c conda-forge ruby compilers make imagemagick
gem install bundler
```

Run `bundle install` and `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start a local server. To build for production, run `bundle exec jekyll build` and copy `_site` to the server.

If you also want to remove unused css classes from your file, run:

```bash
$ purgecss -c purgecss.config.js
```

which will replace the css files in the `_site/assets/css/` folder with the purged css files.

**Note:** Make sure to correctly set the `url` and `baseurl` fields in `_config.yml` before building the webpage. If you are deploying your webpage to `your-domain.com/your-project/`, you must set `url: your-domain.com` and `baseurl: /your-project/`. If you are deploying directly to `your-domain.com`, leave `baseurl` blank, **do not delete it**.

## Blog post formatting
