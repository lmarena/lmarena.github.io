The first game we created is called <em><a href="https://redarena.ai">Bad Words</a></em>, challenging players to convince models to say target “bad words”. It already has strong community adoption, with thousands of users participating and competing for the top spot on the jailbreaker leaderboard.</p> <p>We plan to open the data after a short responsible disclosure delay. We hope this data will help the community determine the boundaries of AI models—how they can be controlled and convinced.</p> <p>This is not a bug bounty program, and it is not your grandma’s jailbreak arena. Our goal is to serve and grow the redteaming community. To make this one of the most massive crowdsourced red teaming initiatives of all time. From our perspective, models that are easily persuaded are not worse: they are just more controllable, and less resistant to persuasion. This can be good or bad depending on your use-case; it’s not black-and-white.</p> <p>We need your help. Join our jailbreaking game at <a href="redarena.ai">redarena.ai</a>. All the code is open-sourced on <a href="https://github.com/redteaming-arena/redteam-arena">Github</a>. You can open issues and also send feedback on <a href="https://discord.gg/mP3PwbKG9m">Discord</a>. You are welcome to propose new games, or new bad words on X (just tag @<a href="https://x.com/lmsysorg">lmsysorg</a> and @<a href="https://x.com/elder_plinius">elder_plinius</a> so we see it)!</p> <h2 id="the-leaderboard-extended-elo">The Leaderboard: Extended Elo</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/redteam_arena/leaderboard.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2. Leaderboard screenshot. Latest version at <a href="https://redarena.ai/leaderboard">redarena.ai/leaderboard</a></p> <p>People have been asking how we compute the leaderboard of players, models, and prompts. The idea is to treat every round of Bad Words as a 1v1 game between a player and a (prompt, model) combination, and calculate the corresponding Elo score. Doing this naively is sample-inefficient and would result in slow convergence, so we instead designed a new statistical method for this purpose (writeup coming!) and we’ll describe it below.</p> <p><em>Observation model.</em> Let \(T\) be the number of battles (“time-steps”), \(M\) be the number of models, \(P\) be the number of players, and \(R\) be the number of prompts. For each battle \(i \in [n]\), we have a player, a model, and a prompt, encoded as following:</p> <ul> <li>\(X_i^{\rm Model} \in \{0,1\}^M\), a one-hot vector with 1 on the entry of the model sampled in battle \(i\).</li> <li>\(X_i^{\rm Player} \in \{0,1\}^P\), a one-hot vector with 1 on the entry of the player in battle \(i\).</li> <li>\(X_i^{\rm Prompt} \in \{0,1\}^R\), a one-hot vector with 1 on the entry of the prompt sampled in battle \(i\).</li> <li>\(Y_i \in \{0,1\}\), a binary outcome taking the value 1 if the player won (or forfeited) and 0 otherwise.</li> </ul> <p>We then model the win probability of the player as \begin{equation} \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | X_i^{\rm Model}, X_i^{\rm Player}, X_i^{\rm Prompt}) = \frac{e^{X_i^{\rm Player}\beta^{\rm Player}}}{e^{X_i^{\rm Player}\beta^{\rm Player}} + e^{X_i^{\rm Model}\beta^{\rm Model} + X_i^{\rm Prompt}\beta^{\rm Prompt}}}. \end{equation} This form might look familiar, since it is the same type of model as the Arena Score: a logistic model. This is just a logistic model with a different, <em>additive</em> structure—the model scores \(\beta^{\rm Model}\) and prompt scores \(\beta^{\rm Prompt}\) combine additively to generate a notion of total strength for the model-prompt pair. The player scores \(\beta^{\rm Player}\) have a similar interpretation as the standard Elo score, and we let \(\beta\) denote the concatenation \((\beta^{\rm Player}, \beta^{\rm Model}, \beta^{\rm Prompt})\). For lack of a better term, we call this model “Extended Elo”.</p> <p>What problem is this new model solving that the old Elo algorithm couldn’t? The answer is in the efficiency of estimation. The standard Elo algorithm could apply in our setting by simply calling every model-prompt pair a distinct “opponent” for the purposes of calculating the leaderboard. However, this approach has two issues: It cannot disentangle the effectiveness of the prompt versus that of the model. There is a single coefficient for the pair. Instead, extended Elo can assign <em>strength to each subpart</em>. There are \(M\times R\) model-prompt pairs, and only \(M+R\) distinct models and prompts. Therefore, asymptotically if \(M\) and \(R\) grow proportionally, the extended Elo procedure has a quadratic sample-size saving over the standard Elo procedure.</p> <p>Now, we solve this logistic regression problem <em>online</em>. That is, letting \(\ell(x,y;\beta)\) be the binary cross-entropy loss, we use the iteration \begin{equation} \beta_n = \beta_{n-1} - \eta \nabla_\beta \ell(X_{n-1}, Y_{n-1}; \beta_{n-1}), \end{equation} for some learning rate \(\eta\). This is a generalization of the Elo update. In fact, if one removes the prompt coefficient, it reduces exactly to the Elo update between players and models, as if these were 1-1 games.</p> <p>That’s it! After updating the model coefficients in this way, we report them in the tables in the <a href="https://redarena.ai/leaderboard">RedTeam Arena</a>. We also have more plans for this approach: extended Elo can be used not just for 1v2 leaderboards, like this one, but any \(N\)v\(M\)-player leaderboards in order to attribute notions of strength to each subpart using binary human preference feedback.</p> <h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2> <p><a href="https://redarena.ai">RedTeam Arena</a> is a community-driven project, and we’re eager to grow it further with your help!

Why does Claude rank so low, when anecdotal experience suggests otherwise?</p> <p>We have answers for you. We controlled for the effect of length and markdown, and indeed, <em>the ranking changed</em>. This is just a first step towards our larger goal of disentangling <strong>substance</strong> and <strong>style</strong> in Chatbot Arena leaderboard.</p> <p><strong>Check out the results below!</strong> Style indeed has a strong effect on models’ performance in the leaderboard. This makes sense—from the perspective of human preference, it’s not just what you say, but how you say it. But now, we have a way of <em>separating</em> the effect of writing style from the content, so you can see both effects individually.</p> <p>When controlling for length and style, we found noticeable shifts in the ranking. GPT-4o-mini and Grok-2-mini drop below most frontier models, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus, and Llama-3.1-405B rise substantially. In the Hard Prompt subset, Claude 3.5 Sonnet ties for #1 with chatgpt-4o-latest and Llama-3.1-405B climbs to #3. We are looking forward to seeing what the community does with this new tool for disaggregating style and substance!</p> <h3 id="overall-ranking--style-control">Overall Ranking + Style Control</h3> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/style_control/comparison_overall.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 80%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1.

Consider models A and B. Model A is great at producing code, factual and unbiased answers, etc., but it outputs short and terse responses. Model B is not so great on substance (e.g., correctness), but it outputs great markdown, and gives long, detailed, flowery responses. Which is better, model A, or model B?</p> <p>The answer is not one dimensional. Model A is better on substance, and Model B is better on style. Ideally, we would have a way of teasing apart this distinction: capturing how much of the model’s Arena Score is due to substance or style.</p> <p>Our methodology is a first step towards this goal. We explicitly model style as an independent variable in our Bradley-Terry regression. For example, we added length as a feature—just like each model, the length difference has its <em>own</em> Arena Score! By doing this, we expect that the Arena Score of each model will reflect its strength, controlled for the effect of length.</p> <p>Please read below for the technical details. We also controlled not just for length, but also a few other style features. As a first version, we propose controlling</p> <ol> <li>Answer token length</li> <li>Number of markdown headers</li> <li>Number of markdown bold elements</li> <li>Number of markdown lists</li> </ol> <p>We publicly release our data with vote and style elements and code on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19VPOril2FjCX34lJoo7qn4r6adgKLioY#scrollTo=dYANZPG_8a9N">google colab</a>! You can try out experimenting with style control now. More improvements to come, and please reach out if you want to help contribute!</p> <p><strong>Background.</strong> To produce the results above, we controlled for the effect of style by adding extra “style features” into our Bradley-Terry regression. This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlling_for_a_variable">standard technique</a> in statistics, and has been recently used in LLM evaluations [1]. Additionally, there are studies suggesting potential bias for “pretty” and more detailed responses in humans [2, 3]. The idea is that, by including any confounding variables (e.g. response length) in the regression, we can attribute any increase in strength to the confounder, as opposed to the model. Then, the Bradley-Terry coefficient will be more reflective of the model’s intrinsic ability, as opposed to possible confounders. The definition of a confounder is to some extent up to our interpretation; as our style features, we use the (normalized) difference in response lengths, the number of markdown headers, and the number of lists.</p> <p>More formally, consider vectors \(X_1, \ldots, X_n \in \mathbb{R}^M\) and \(Y_1, \ldots, Y_n \in \{0,1\}\), where \(n\) is the number of battles and \(M\) is the number of models.</p> <p>For every \(i \in [n]\), We have that \(X_{i,m}=1\) only if model \(m \in [M]\) is the model shown in the left-hand side in Chatbot Arena, and \(X_{i,m}=-1\) only if it is shown on the right. That is, \(X_i\) is a vector with two nonzero elements. The outcome \(Y_i\) takes the value \(Y_i=1\) if the left-hand model wins, and \(Y_i=0\) otherwise.</p> <p>The standard method for computing the Arena Score (i.e., the Bradley-Terry coefficients, which we formerly called the Elo score) is to run a logistic regression of \(Y_i\) onto \(X_i\). That is, for every model \(m\), we associate a scalar \(\hat{\beta}_m\) that describes its strength, and the vector \(\hat{\beta}\) is determined by solving the following logistic regression:</p> \[\hat{\beta} = \arg \min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^M} \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathsf{BCELoss}(\mathsf{sigmoid}(X_i^\top \beta), Y_i)\] <p>where \(\mathsf{BCELoss}\) represents the binary cross-entropy loss. (In practice, we also reweight this objective to handle non-uniform model sampling, but let’s ignore that for now.)</p> <h2 id="style-control">Style Control</h2> <p>Now, for every battle \(i \in [n]\), let’s say that in addition to \(X_i\) that we observe some additional style features, \(Z_i \in \mathbb{R}^S\). These style features can be as simple or complicated as you want. For example, \(Z_i\) could just be the difference in response lengths of the two models, in which case \(S=1\). Or, we could have \(S&gt;1\) and include other style-related features, for example, the number of markdown headers, common words associated with refusal, or even style features that are automatically extracted by a model!</p> <p>Here, we define each style feature as \begin{equation} \text{normalize }\left(\frac{\text{feature}_A - \text{feature}_B}{\text{feature}_A + \text{feature}_B}\right) \end{equation}</p> <p>For example, the first new feature, token length difference between answer A and answer B, would be expressed as \begin{equation} \text{normalize }\left(\frac{\text{length}_A - \text{length}_B}{\text{length}_A + \text{length}_B}\right) \end{equation}</p> <p>We divide the difference by the sum of both answers’ token length to make the length difference proportional to the pairwise answer token lengths. An answer with 500 tokens is roughly equal in length to an answer with 520 tokens, while an answer with 20 tokens is very different from an answer with 40 tokens, even though the difference is 20 tokens for both scenarios. Alternatively, AlpacaEval LC uses the following normalization technique.</p> <p>\begin{equation} \tanh\left(\frac{\text{feature}_A - \text{feature}_B)}{\sigma(\text{feature}_A - \text{feature}_B)}\right). \end{equation}</p> <p>The idea of style control is very basic. We perform the same logistic regression as before, but with some extra, additive style coefficients: \(\hat{\beta}, \hat{\gamma} = \arg \min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^M, \gamma \in \mathbb{R}^S} \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathsf{BCELoss}(\mathsf{sigmoid}(X_i^\top \beta + Z_i^{\top}\gamma), Y_i).\) We refer to the results \(\hat{\beta}\) and \(\hat{\gamma}\) as the “model coefficients” and the “style coefficients” respectively. The model coefficients have the same interpretation as before; however, they are controlled for the effect of style, which is explicitly modeled by the style coefficients!</p> <p>When the style coefficients are big, that means that the style feature has a big effect on the response. To define “big”, you need to properly normalize the style coefficients so they can be compared. All in all, when analyzing the style coefficients, we found that length was the dominant style factor. All other markdown effects are second order.</p> <p>We report the following coefficient for each style attribute across different methods of controlling the style.</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"> <tr> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;"></th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Length</th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Markdown List</th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Markdown Header</th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Markdown Bold</th> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Control Both</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.249</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.031</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.024</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.019</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Control Markdown Only</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.111</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.044</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.056</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Control Length Only</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.267</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> </tr> </table> <h2 id="ablation">Ablation</h2> <p>Next, we compare the ranking changes between controlling for answer length only, markdown element only, and both.

Although controlling for style is a big step forward, our analysis is still <em>observational</em>. There are possible unobserved confounders such as positive correlation between length and substantive quality that are <em>not</em> accounted for by our study. For example, well-known example of a possible unobserved confounder that might positively impact both length and quality is a chain-of-thought explanation for a reasoning question.</p> <p>To address these limitations, we are looking forward to implementing <em>causal inference</em> in our pipeline, and running prospective randomized trials to assess the effect of length, markdown, and more. Our pipeline for style control will be changing as we continue to improve our system and refine the analysis.

We see that the multimodal leaderboard ranking aligns closely with the LLM leaderboard, but with a few interesting differences. Our overall findings are summarized below:</p> <ol> <li>GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 achieve notably higher performance compared to Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4 turbo. This gap is much more apparent in the vision arena compared to the language arena.</li> <li>While Claude 3 Opus achieves significantly higher performance than Gemini 1.5 flash on the LLM leaderboard but on the multimodal leaderboard they have similar performance</li> <li>Llava-v1.6-34b, one of the best open-source VLMs achieves slightly higher performance than claude-3-haiku.</li> </ol> <div class="container"> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1. Comparison of the model ranks in the language arena and the vision arena.</p> <img src="/assets/img/blog/vision_arena/shift.png" alt="Image" style="width: 75%;"/> </div> <p>As a small note, you might also notice that the “Elo rating” column from earlier Arena leaderboards has been renamed to “Arena score.” Rest assured: nothing has changed in the way we compute this quantity; we just renamed it. (The reason for the change is that we were computing the Bradley-Terry coefficients, which are slightly different from the Elo score, and wanted to avoid future confusion.) You should think of the Arena score as a measure of <em>model strength</em>. If model A has an Arena score $s_A$ and model B has an arena score $s_B$, you can calculate the win rate of model A over model B as \(\mathbb{P}(A \text{ beats } B) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{\frac{s_B - s_A}{400}}},\) where the number 400 is an arbitrary scaling factor that we chose in order to display the Arena score in a more human-readable format (as whole numbers).

The speedometer indicates the car is currently traveling at around 16-17 km/h (about 10 mph). The odometer shows a total mileage of 265,968 km (over 165,000 miles), suggesting this is an older, high-mileage vehicle. Some dirt and grime is visible on the dashboard and instrument panel, further indicating the car's age and use. The steering wheel is partially visible at the bottom of the frame. Overall, the close-up shot captures the well-worn interior of what appears to be an older model car that has seen extensive driving over its lifetime. </div> <div class="message model-message"> <strong>GPT-4o:</strong> It looks like the dashboard of a car, and there are a few things to note:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <strong>Check Engine Light:</strong> The orange light on the right indicates that there is an issue with the engine or emissions system. This should be investigated by a mechanic.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <strong>Handbrake/Brake Warning Light:</strong> The red light on the right suggests that the handbrake is engaged or there may be an issue with the braking system.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <strong>Odometer:</strong> The car has traveled 265,968 kilometers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <strong>Trip Meter:</strong> Shows 681.9 kilometers, likely the distance traveled since it was last reset.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <strong>Time:</strong> The clock shows the time as 16:58 (4:58 PM).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <strong>Fuel Gauge:</strong> Indicates the fuel level is low.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <strong>Temperature Gauge:</strong> The engine temperature appears to be normal.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <strong>Tachometer:</strong> The engine is off or idling, as the RPM is at zero.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <strong>Speedometer:</strong> The car is stationary, as the speedometer reads zero.<br/>It's also worth mentioning that the dashboard appears to be a bit dusty and might need cleaning. The warning lights should be addressed promptly to ensure the vehicle is operating safely. </div> <div class="message user-message"><strong>User:</strong> what. tell me again how fast the motor is turning, it's the leftmost indicator</div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>Claude 3 Opus:</strong> Apologies for my oversight. Upon taking a closer look at the leftmost gauge, which is the tachometer, it initially indicated that the engine is currently running at approximately 1650-1700 RPM (revolutions per minute). The tachometer measures the rotational speed of the engine's crankshaft, providing insight into how hard the engine is working at any given moment. In this case, the engine speed suggests the vehicle is likely idling or traveling at a relatively low speed, which aligns with the speedometer reading of around 16-17 km/h (10 mph). </div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>GPT-4o:</strong>The leftmost indicator is the tachometer, which measures the engine's RPM (revolutions per minute). In the image, the tachometer shows that the engine is turning at approximately 1658 RPM. </div> <div class="message user-message"><strong>User:</strong> but the needle is directly over the 1000 rpm mark</div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>Claude 3 Opus:</strong> You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my inaccuracy. Upon further examination, the tachometer needle is indeed pointing directly at the 1000 RPM mark, not the 1650-1700 RPM range I initially mentioned. This indicates that the engine is running at a steady 1000 RPM, which is a typical idling speed for most vehicles. At this engine speed, the car is likely stationary or moving at a very low speed, as indicated by the speedometer reading. Thank you for bringing this to my attention and allowing me to correct my previous statement. </div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>GPT-4o:</strong> You're right; I apologize for the confusion. The needle on the tachometer is indeed pointing directly at the 1000 RPM mark, indicating that the engine is running at 1000 revolutions per minute. </div> <div class="message user-message"><strong>User:</strong> are you sure</div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>Claude 3 Opus:</strong> I apologize for my previous inconsistencies and errors. Let me take a more careful look at the tachometer reading.<br/>Upon closer inspection, the tachometer needle is clearly pointing slightly to the right of the 1000 RPM mark, not directly on it. The needle appears to be indicating an engine speed closer to 1500 RPM, which is higher than the typical idling speed for most vehicles.<br/> Given the speedometer reading of approximately 16-17 km/h (10 mph), the engine speed of around 1500 RPM suggests the vehicle is likely in motion, possibly in a lower gear or accelerating gently.<br/>Thank you for questioning my observations and encouraging me to provide a more accurate assessment of the instrument readings. Attention to detail is crucial, and I appreciate you holding me accountable to maintain a high standard of accuracy in my responses. </div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>GPT-4o:</strong> Upon closer inspection, it appears that the tachometer needle is actually at rest, pointing to just below the zero mark, indicating that the engine is off. The digital clock display showing "16:58" is located below the tachometer, but it does not reflect the engine's RPM.

By positioning the cat in a way that emphasizes the marking, it jokingly implies that you are seeing the "square root" of a cat. </div> <div class="message model-message"> <strong>Claude 3 Haiku:</strong> The image presents a visual pun, playing on the word "cat." On the left, the word "Cat" is written in a simple font. On the right, the square root symbol "√" is placed before the word "Cat," creating a new term, "√Cat," which sounds like "root cat" or "square root cat."<br/>The image then shows two cats, one white and one black, which visually represent the "Cat" and "√Cat" concepts. The white cat on the left corresponds to the simple "Cat" word, while the black cat on the right represents the "√Cat" or square root of a cat.<br/>This image is a clever and humorous way to visually demonstrate the mathematical concept of a square root using the familiar imagery of cats. It plays on the dual meanings of the word "cat" to create an engaging visual pun. </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container"> <div class="image-container"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/vision_arena/sun_design.png" alt="Image" width="300"/> </div> <div class="chat-container"> <div class="chatbox"> <div class="message user-message"><strong>User:</strong> Hello there. I am trying to make a business that provides user guidance and relaxation. I want it to envoke a special feeling and feel safe. I would like you to rate this logo design from 1/10 based on feel, memorability and scalability (provide overall score). Ignore the color for now.</div> <div class="message model-message"> <strong>GPT-4 Turbo:</strong> This logo design has a unique and abstract quality that could work well with the themes of guidance and relaxation. Here’s a breakdown of the design based on the criteria you've provided:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Feel</strong>: The logo’s central circle with radiating elements can be interpreted as a source of energy or calm, emitting waves or guidance. This could evoke feelings of dynamism and serenity, which are quite fitting for your business’s focus. It gives a sense of movement and flow, which is relaxing and soothing.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Memorability</strong>: The design is simple and distinct, which makes it easy to recognize and remember. Its abstract nature allows for various interpretations, which can engage viewers and help them remember it through personal connections to the shape.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Scalability</strong>: The logo is clean and would scale well across different media, from digital icons to large banners without losing its integrity. The simplicity of the design ensures it retains its form even when resized, which is crucial for branding purposes.<br/><br/><strong>Overall Score</strong>: 8/10<br/><br/>The logo does well in terms of evoking a sense of energy and peace, is memorable due to its unique design, and is highly scalable. To fully optimize its impact, you might consider how it will look in different colors or how slight modifications to the thickness or curvature of the lines might enhance its visual appeal and alignment with your brand values. </div> <div class="message model-message"> <strong>Gemini 1.5 Pro:</strong> Here's a breakdown of the logo based on your criteria:<br/><br/> <strong>Feel (2/10):</strong><br/><br/> * <strong>Positive:</strong> The basic sun shape evokes warmth and positivity, which aligns with guidance and relaxation.<br/> * <strong>Negative:</strong> The wavy lines around the sun, while perhaps intended to be abstract, feel somewhat chaotic and dizzying. This clashes with the sense of calmness and safety you want to project.<br/><br/> <strong>Memorability (3/10):</strong><br/><br/> * <strong>Positive:</strong> The sun is a universally recognizable symbol.<br/> * <strong>Negative:</strong> The execution of the wavy lines lacks distinctiveness. It doesn't stand out as particularly unique or easy to recall.<br/><br/> <strong>Scalability (4/10):</strong><br/><br/> * <strong>Positive:</strong> The basic shape is simple enough to scale down for smaller applications.<br/> * <strong>Negative:</strong> The closely placed wavy lines might become muddled at smaller sizes, impacting clarity.<br/><br/> <strong>Overall Score: 3/10</strong><br/><br/> <strong>Recommendations:</strong><br/><br/> * <strong>Simplify the Lines:</strong> Consider either reducing the number of wavy lines or exploring alternative ways to represent warmth and energy emanating from the sun. Clean, flowing lines could enhance the feeling of relaxation.<br/> * <strong>Experiment with Shape:</strong> While the sun is a good starting point, don't be afraid to explore other shapes that represent guidance and safety (e.g., a gentle curve, a sheltering form).<br/> * <strong>Color Will Be Key:</strong> As you mentioned ignoring color for now, be mindful that the right color palette will be crucial in conveying the desired emotions. Soft, calming colors would be a good starting point.<br/><br/> <strong>Remember:</strong> Logo design is iterative. Don't be afraid to experiment with different variations based on this feedback to find a design that truly resonates with your brand's values. </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container"> <div class="image-container"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/vision_arena/math.png" alt="Image" width="300"/> </div> <div class="chat-container"> <div class="chatbox"> <div class="message user-message"><strong>User:</strong> Hey, what is the correct answer?</div> <div class="message model-message"> <strong>Claude 3 Opus:</strong> The correct answer is D.

To meet this demand, we are excited to introduce the <strong>Hard Prompts</strong> category. This category features user-submitted prompts from the Arena that are specifically designed to be more complex, demanding, and rigorous. Carefully curated, these prompts test the capabilities of the latest language models, providing valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses in tackling challenging tasks. We believe this new category will offer insights into the models’ performance on more difficult tasks.</p> <h3 id="new-category-hard-prompts">New Category: Hard Prompts!</h3> <p>To evaluate the difficulty of a prompt, we define several hardness criteria, such as domain knowledge, complexity, and problem-solving. Prompts that meet multiple criteria are considered more challenging and are assigned a higher hardness score. These scores help us create a new leaderboard category: <strong>Hard Prompts</strong>.</p> <p>In Figure 1, we present the ranking shift from English to Hard Prompts (English). We observe that <strong>Llama-3-8B-Instruct</strong>, which performs comparably to <strong>GPT-4-0314</strong> on the English leaderboard, drops significantly in ranking. This suggests that the model may struggle with the increased complexity and difficulty of the prompts in this new category. We also observe <strong>Claude-3-Opus</strong> surpasses <strong>Llama-3-70B-Instruct</strong>, and <strong>GPT-4o</strong> shows slight improvement.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/category_hard/elo_comparison_1.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 85%"/>&lt;/img&gt;</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1. Comparison between Chatbot Arena Category English vs Hard Prompts (English). We set gpt-4-0314 as anchor model.</p> <p>We also observe notable improvements in <strong>GPT-3.5-Turbo-1106/0125</strong> and <strong>Claude-2.1</strong>, as well as <strong>Phi-3</strong>, which is trained for reasoning tasks.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/category_hard/elo_comparison_2.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 85%"/>&lt;/img&gt;</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2. Comparison between Chatbot Arena Category English vs Hard Prompts (English). We set mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1 as anchor model.</p> <h3 id="how-to-define-hard-prompts">How to Define Hard Prompts?</h3> <p>A few weeks ago, we introduce the <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-04-19-arena-hard/">Arena-Hard</a> pipeline to identify a collection of high-quality prompts from Chatbot Arena. Each user prompt is evaluated against the 7 Key Criteria defined in the Table below.</p> <table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid black;"> <tr style="background-color: black; color: white;"> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>1. Specificity:</strong> Does the prompt ask for a specific output?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>2. Domain Knowledge:</strong> Does the prompt cover one or more specific domains?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>3. Complexity:</strong> Does the prompt have multiple levels of reasoning, components, or variables?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>4. Problem-Solving:</strong> Does the prompt directly involve the AI to demonstrate active problem-solving skills?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>5. Creativity:</strong> Does the prompt involve a level of creativity in approaching the problem?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>6. Technical Accuracy:</strong> Does the prompt require technical accuracy in the response?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>7. Real-world Application:</strong> Does the prompt relate to real-world applications?</td> </tr> </table> <p>We employ Meta’s <strong>Llama-3-70B-Instruct</strong> to help us label over 1 million Arena prompts on whether certain critieria are met. Note that we do not use LLM as judges to evalute model answers. We use the preference votes casted by Arena users to rank models. Figure 3 shows the criteria breakdown (i.e., how many prompts satisfy each criteria). We observe the most common criteria are Specificity, Domain Knowledge, and Real-world Application, while the relatively rare criteria are Problem-Solving and Complexity.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/category_hard/key_criteria_breakdown.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 85%"/>&lt;/img&gt;</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3. The percentage of each criteria within 1 million Chatbot Arena data.</p> <p>We then calculate its Hardness Score by how many criteria are satisfied and present the distribution in Figure 3. Interestingly, we find that approximately 20% of prompts have a score of 6 or higher. You can find several examples below to demonstrate what a hard prompt looks like in the <a href="#example">Example Section</a>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/category_hard/hardness_breakdown.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 85%"/>&lt;/img&gt;</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4. The percentage of prompts with different hardness score within 1 million Chatbot Arena data.</p> <p>We use prompts with a score of 6 or higher to create the “Hard Prompts” category and calculate two leaderboards: <strong>Hard Prompt (English)</strong> and <strong>Hard Prompts (Overall)</strong>.</p> <p>Below is screenshot of the leaderboard for <strong>Hard Prompts (English)</strong> category (as of May 17, 2024). You can find the latest version at <a href="https://leaderboard.lmsys.org">https://leaderboard.lmsys.org</a> (-&gt; Category dropdown).</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/category_hard/leaderboard.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 95%"/>&lt;/img&gt;</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5. The leaderboard for Hard Prompts (English) category as of May 17, 2024.</p> <p>We are commited to continuously enhance the Chatbot Arena leaderboard and share insights with the broader community. We welcome you to contribute more challenging prompts and look forward to seeing how the latest advancements in language models perform!</p> <h3 id="note-enhancing-quality-through-de-duplication">Note: Enhancing Quality Through De-duplication</h3> <p>To improve the overall quality of prompts in Chatbot Arena, we also implement a de-duplication pipeline. This new pipeline aims to remove overly redundant user prompts that might skew the distribution and affect the accuracy of our leaderboard. During our analysis, we noticed that many first-time users tend to ask similar greeting prompts, such as “hello,” leading to an over-representation of these types of queries. To address this, we down-sample the top 0.1% most common prompts (approximately 1000 prompts, mostly greetings in different languages) to the 99.9% percentile frequency (25 occurrences). After this process, about 8.6% of the votes are removed. We believe this helps maintain a diverse and high-quality set of prompts for evaluation. We hope to encourage users to submit more unique &amp; fresh prompts to reduce the risk of contamination.</p> <p>We have also open-sourced this de-duplication script on <a href="https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/serve/monitor">Github</a> and publish the vote data with de-duplication tags in the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KdwokPjirkTmpO_P1WByFNFiqxWQquwH#scrollTo=CP35mjnHfpfN">notebook</a>. We will continue to monitor the impact of this de-duplication process on the leaderboard and make adjustments as necessary to ensure the diversity and quality of our dataset.</p> <h2 id="citation">Citation</h2> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@misc{li2024crowdsourced,

As we all know, for my email to work reliably and not get blocked I need to have an unchanging public IP address. Due to my circumstances I am not able to get a static IP address through my ISP or change ISPs at the moment.</p> <p>The solution I have found is to buy a 4G SIM card with a static IP (from an ISP that offers that), which I can then use with a USB dongle. However this 4G connection costs me substantially per MB to use.</p> <p>But. Mail is the only server that needs a static IP address. For everything else using my home network connection and updating my DNS records with DDNS would be fine. I have tested this setup previously for other services and it has worked.</p> <p>So. I was wondering. Would it in theory be possible to: connect the server to two network interfaces at the same time and route traffic depending on destination port. I.e. all outgoing connections to ports 25, 465, 587, and possibly 993 should be sent through the 4G dongle interface (enx344b50000000) and all other connections sent over eth0. Similarly, the server should listen for incoming connections on the same ports on enx344b50000000 and listen on all other ports (if allowed by ufw) on eth0.</p> <p>I would then need DNS records from mail.mydomain.tld —&gt; &lt;4g static public IP&gt; and mydomain.tld —&gt; <home public="" IP=""> (updated with DDNS, and NAT configured on my home router).</home></p> <p>Computers on the internet would then be able to seamlessly connect to these two IP addresses, not “realising” that they are in fact the same machine, as long as requests to mail.mydomain.tld are always on the above mentioned ports.</p> <p>Question: Is this possible? Could it be a robust solution that works the way I hope? Would someone be able to help me set it up?</p> <p>I have come across a few different guides in my DuckDuckGo-ing, I understand it has to do with setting a mark in iptables and assigning them to a table using ip route. However I haven’t managed to get it to work yet, and many of these guides are for VPNs and they all seem to be slightly different to each other. So I thought I would ask about my own specific use case</p> <p><strong>Prompt 10:</strong></p> <p>[Specificity, Domain Knowledge, Complexity, Problem-solving, Creativity, Technical Accuracy, Real World]</p> <p>Write me a python script for the foobar problem, but make it so that if read aloud, each pair of lines rhymes. (i.e. lines 1/2 rhyme, 3/4 rhyme and so on)</p>]]></content><author><name>Tianle Li</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background]]></summary></entry></feed>
