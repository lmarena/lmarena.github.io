However, understanding what people ask, how they structure prompts, and how models perform isn’t straightforward. Raw text data is messy and complex. Analyzing small samples is feasible, but identifying trends in large datasets is challenging. This isn’t just our problem. Anyone dealing with unstructured data, e.g. long texts and images, faces the same question: how do you organize it to extract meaningful insights?</p> <p>To address this, we developed a topic modeling pipeline and the <strong>Arena Explorer</strong>. This pipeline organizes user prompts into distinct topics, structuring the text data hierarchically to enable intuitive analysis. We believe this tool for hierarchical topic modeling can be valuable to anyone analyzing complex text data.</p> <div class="l-page" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"> <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; height: 0; padding-bottom: 70%; margin-bottom: 20px"> <iframe src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-arena-no-cors/trial/index.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="yes" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: white;" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </div> </div> <p>In this blog post, we will cover:</p> <ul> <li>Analysis of LLM performance insights received from Arena Explorer.</li> <li>Details of how we created the Explorer, transforming a large dataset of user conversations into an exploratory tool.</li> <li>Ways to fine-tune and improve topic models.</li> </ul> <p>Check out the pipeline in this colab notebook, <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1chzqjePYnpq08fA3KzyKvSkuzCjojyiE?usp=sharing">Link</a>, and try it out yourself.</p> <p>You can find the dataset we used here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmarena-ai/arena-explorer-preference-100k">Link</a>. This dataset contains 100k leaderboard conversation data, the largest prompt dataset with human preferences we have every released!</p> <h2 id="insights">Insights</h2> <p><strong>Model Performance Comparison</strong></p> <p>In our previous <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/arena-category/">blog post</a>, we conducted an in-depth categorical analysis and discussed key insights. That analysis was based on manually defined categories in Chatbot Arena. The results showed that language models perform differently across categories. With our topic modeling pipeline, we can now analyze model performance across categories more efficiently and dive deeper into specific topics.</p> <p>Compared to <em>Tech Programming</em>, model rankings for the other two largest broad categories, <em>Creative Writing</em> and <em>Puzzles &amp; Math</em>, shifted significantly.</p> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/rank_broad_cat.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1. Tech Programming vs. Creative Writing vs. Puzzles Chatbot Arena ranking of the top 10 ranked models in Tech Programming.</p> <p>Claude performed better than Gemini in <em>Tech Programming</em>, while Gemini outperformed Claude in <em>Creative Writing</em>.

Tech Programming vs. Creative Writing Chatbot Arena Score computed using the Bradley-Terry model.</p> <p><strong>Diving into Narrow Categories</strong></p> <p>Model performance analysis can be broken down into more specific categories based on win rates. We calculated the win rates of Gemini 1.5, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 across the narrow categories, treating ties as 0.5 wins. Gemini 1.5 performed best in <em>Entrepreneurship and Business Strategy</em> but had a noticeably lower win rate in <em>Songwriting and Playlist Creation</em>. In contrast, GPT-4o maintained a relatively consistent win rate across most categories, except for a dip in <em>Entrepreneurship and Business Strategy</em>. Claude 3.5 excelled in <em>Web Development</em> and <em>Linux &amp; Shell Scripting</em> but had lower win rates in other, less technical categories.</p> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/winrate_narrow.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3. Model win rates in the eight largest narrow categories.</p> <p>Even within the same broad category, model performance varies slightly. For example, within <em>Tech Programming</em>, GPT-4o showed a lower win rate in <em>GPU and CPU Performance and Comparison</em> compared to other categories. Within <em>Creative Writing</em>, Gemini had a significantly higher win rate in <em>Genshin Impact Parody Adventures</em>.</p> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/winrate_tech.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4.

Model win rates in the eight largest narrow categories within Creative Writing.</p> <p>Note: Since models compete against different sets of opponents, win rates are only meaningful when compared within the same model. Therefore, we do not directly compare win rates across different models.</p> <h2 id="topic-modeling-pipeline">Topic Modeling Pipeline</h2> <p>We used the leaderboard conversation data between June 2024 and August 2024. To facilitate clustering in later steps, we selected prompts tagged in English and removed duplicate prompts. The final dataset contains around 52k prompts.</p> <p>To group the prompts into narrow categories, we used a topic modeling pipeline with <a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html">BERTopic</a>, similar to the one presented in our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132">(Chiang, 2024)</a>. We performed the following steps.</p> <ol> <li>We create embeddings for user prompts with SentenceTransformers’ model (all-mpnet-base-v2), transforming prompts into representation vectors.</li> <li>To reduce the dimensionality of embeddings, we use UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)</li> <li>We use the density distribution-based clustering algorithm HDBSCAN to identify topic clusters with a minimum clustering size of 20.</li> <li>We select 20 example prompts per cluster. They were chosen from the ones with high HDBSCAN probability scores (top 20% within their respective clusters). For clarity, we choose those with fewer than 100 words.</li> <li>To come up with cluster names, we feed the example prompts into ChatGPT-4o to give the category a name and description.</li> <li>We reduced all outliers using probabilities obtained from HDBSCAN and then embeddings of each outlier prompt. This pipeline groups the prompts into narrow categories, each with 20 example prompts.</li> </ol> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/intertopic_distance.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="700px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6. The intertropical distance map shows the narrow clusters identified by BERTopic. The size of the circles is proportional to the amount of prompts in the cluster.</p> <p>We consolidate the initial narrow categories into broad categories for more efficient and intuitive exploration. We perform a second round of this topic clustering pipeline on the summarized category names and descriptions generated earlier. The steps are almost identical to before. Except for steps 4 and 5, we use all category names in a cluster for summarization instead of selecting examples.</p> <h3 id="tuning-topic-clusters">Tuning Topic Clusters</h3> <p>Topic clusters are not always accurate. Some prompts may not be placed in the most suitable cluster, and the same applies to specific categories. Many factors influence the final clustering:</p> <ol> <li>Embedding models used to generate vector representations for prompts</li> <li>Sampled example prompts used to assign cluster names</li> <li>BERTopic model parameters that affect the number of clusters, such as n_neighbors in UMAP and min_cluster_size in HDBSCAN</li> <li>Outlier reduction methods</li> </ol> <p><strong>How do we improve and fine-tune the clusters?</strong> Embedding models play a major role in clustering accuracy since they are used to train the clustering model. We compared two models on a 10k sample dataset: Sentence Transformer’s all-mpnet-base-v2 and OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-large, a more recent model. According to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">MTEB Leaderboard</a>, text-embedding-3-large performs better on average (57.77). The clustering results are noticeably different.</p> <p>With text-embedding-3-large, the broad category distribution is more balanced. In contrast, all-mpnet-base-v2 produced a large <em>Tech Programming</em> category. Zooming in on this category, we found that AI-related clusters were merged into <em>Tech Programming</em> when using all-mpnet-base-v2, whereas text-embedding-3-large formed a separate AI-related category. Choosing which result to use depends on human preference.</p> <div class="l-page" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/embedding_mpnet_broad.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="700px" width="100%"></iframe> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/embedding_mpnet_tech.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="700px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 7 &amp; 8. Broad categories and specific categories in “Tech Programming” summarized using all-mpnet-base-v2.</p> <div class="l-page" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/embedding_openai_broad.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="700px" width="100%"></iframe> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/embedding_openai_tech.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="700px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 9 &amp; 10. Broad categories and specific categories in “Tech Programming” summarized using text-embedding-3-large.</p> <p>Beyond embedding models, adjusting parameters and outlier reduction methods helps refine the clusters. For example, we increased the min_cluster_size parameter to adjust the broad clusters. Before, several broad categories had similar meanings. By increasing this parameter, we reduced the number of clusters, resulting in more distinctive categories.</p> <h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2> <p>We will add more features to our explorer that provide insights into the connection between model performance and prompt category, such as model performance per category.</p> <p>We would love to hear your feedback and how you are using the pipeline to derive insights!</p> <h2 id="citation">Citation</h2> <div class="language-bibtex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">@misc</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">tang2025explorer</span><span class="p">,</span>

Copilot Arena is no different: Copilot Arena enables not only paired <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/copilot-arena/">code completions</a> but also paired code edits as well. Unlike code completions—which automatically appear after short pauses—code edits are manually triggered by highlighting a code snippet and then writing a short task description. In Copilot Arena specifically, two suggestions (presented as code diffs) are provided and the user is able to vote between them.</p> <p>To date, Copilot Arena has been downloaded over 8.5k times on the VSCode Marketplace! We recently released the Copilot Arena live leaderboard for code completions on lmarena.ai and now the code edit leaderboard, which has 3K votes across 6 top models.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena_edits/demo.png" alt="Demo of Edits" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1.

Here, we will focus on code edit usage.</p> <p><strong>How long are the prompts that people write?</strong> We find that the median prompt length is 34 characters and mean is 139 characters. Most are fairly short and thus depend on the context that is highlighted. In comparison to the chat messages sent by users in Chatbot Arena, user prompts for inline edits tend to be much shorter. The model must instead mostly focus on test the model’s ability to infer user goals based on the context (e.g., the highlighted code snippet).</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena_edits/prompt_char_length.png" alt="Copilot Arena prompt length distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3. Distribution of prompt character lengths.</p> <p><strong>What context lengths are we looking at?</strong> We look at the distribution of code-to-edit token lengths, as computed by the number of highlighted tokens. The median is 138 tokens and the mean is 647 tokens. While there are some outliers, this indicates that most people are highlighting targeted portions of code for edits as this is much shorter than the full file length which is typically closer to 4.5k tokens on average.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena_edits/code_to_edit_token.png" alt="Copilot Arena highlighted length distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4. Number of highlighted tokens</p> <p><strong>What kind of edits are people trying to make?</strong> We find users write prompts for code edits in multiple languages, predominantly English but also in Russian, Chinese, and Spanish.

A few weeks ago, we launched <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=copilot-arena.copilot-arena&amp;ssr=false#overview">Copilot Arena</a>, a <strong>free</strong> AI coding assistant that provides paired responses from different state-of-the-art LLMs. We first introduced paired code completions and more recently rolled out inline editing-a feature where users can highlight code segments, write a prompt, and receive two diff-based suggestions for modifying that code.</p> <p>Thus far, Copilot Arena has been downloaded 2.5K times on the VSCode Marketplace, served over 100K completions, and accumulated over 10K code completion battles. In this blog post, we’ll cover:</p> <ul> <li><a href="#initial-leaderboard-and-results">Initial Leaderboard and Results</a>. Our preliminary results for the code completions leaderboard and analysis of model tiers.</li> <li><a href="#how-do-people-use-copilot-arena">Copilot Arena Usage</a>. Analysis on Copilot Arena usage, including the distribution of coding languages, context lengths, and an initial inspection into position bias.</li> <li><a href="#how-do-we-prompt-chat-models-to-perform-code-completions">Prompting</a>. Details of how we use chat models like Claude Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o to perform code completions (spoiler alert, we generate code snippets and post-process!).</li> </ul> <h2 id="initial-leaderboard-and-results">Initial Leaderboard and Results</h2> <p>As an initial set of models, we selected 9 of the best models across multiple model providers that include both open, code-specific, and commercial models. To ensure a fair comparison between models, we do the following…</p> <ul> <li>We randomize whether models appear at the top or bottom for each completion along with which models are paired for each battle.</li> <li>We show both completions at the same time. This means that a faster model completion needs to wait for the slower model.</li> <li>Many of the models with superior coding capabilities are chat models. As discussed later in the post, we optimize the prompts so they can perform code completions. We manually verified there were no significant formatting issues in the data collected.</li> <li>We set the same max number of output tokens, input tokens, top-p, and temperature (unless specified by the model provider).</li> </ul> <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: fit-content;"> <table class="tg"> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th style="text-align: center;">Arena Score</th> <th style="text-align: center;">Confidence Intervals</th> <th style="text-align: center;">Median Latency (s)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr style="background-color: #EFBF04; color: black"> <td>Deepseek V2.5</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1074</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+16/-11</td> <td style="text-align: center;">2.13</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #EFBF04; color: black"> <td>Claude Sonnet 3.5 (06/20)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1053</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+18/-17</td> <td style="text-align: center;">2.29</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #C0C0C0; color: black"> <td>Codestral (05/24)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1046</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+12/-10</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1.01</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #C0C0C0; color: black"> <td>Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1024</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+17/-15</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1.12</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #CD7F32; color: black"> <td>GPT-4o (08/06)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1016</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+17/-20</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.75</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #CD7F32; color: black"> <td>Gemini-1.5-Pro-002</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1014</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+19/-18</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1.44</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #CD7F32; color: black"> <td>Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1013</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+14/-15</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.88</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #CD7F32; color: black"> <td>Gemini-1.5-Flash-002</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1005</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+16/-22</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.55</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #E8E8E8; color: black"> <td>GPT-4o-mini (07/18)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">962</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+17/-15</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.74</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Table 1. Elo ratings and median latency of nine popular models based on over 10K votes collected between October 16-November 11, 2024. We color rows based on tiers determined by confidence intervals. Each model has at least 1K votes.</p> <p>Table 1 presents the current code completion leaderboard and stratifies them into tiers. Here are our main takeaways:</p> <ul> <li>With a minor prompt tweak, Claude is able to compete with code-specific models (e.g., Deepseek V2.5) on code completion tasks, including ones that require “fill-in-the-middle”. From the beginning, we observed that these Claude and DeepSeek models have emerged as top contenders and separated themselves from the rest of the pack.</li> <li>Within a tier, we still observe slight fluctuations as we obtain more votes. Check out Figure 2 for a breakdown of the win rate percentage for each pair of models.</li> <li>We find that GPT-4o-mini is much worse than all other models.</li> </ul> <p>We follow the same leaderboard computation as the latest version of Chatbot Arena, which is based on learning Bradley-Terry coefficients that minimize loss when predicting whether one model will beat the other.

Fraction of model A wins for all battles</p> <h3 id="the-effect-of-latency">The Effect of Latency</h3> <p>While the Arena scores (Table 1) do not explicitly factor in model latency since both completions are shown simultaneously, we explore whether Arena Scores correlate with latency. We include median latency as a separate column in the results. In general, we find that people don’t necessarily prefer faster models. However, this may be partially because code completions are only generated in Copilot Arena after a user pauses.</p> <h2 id="how-do-people-use-copilot-arena">How do people use Copilot Arena?</h2> <p><strong>What kind of languages do people code in?</strong><br/> Most current Copilot Arena users code in Python, followed by javascript/typescript, html/markdown, and C++. This statistic is determined based on the file extension.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena/filetype_dist.png" alt="Copilot Arena filetype distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3. Filetypes requested in Copilot Arena. Filetypes are determined based on file extension.</p> <p><strong>What kind of context lengths are we looking at?</strong><br/> The mean context length is 1002 tokens and the median is 560 tokens. This is much longer than tasks considered in existing static benchmarks. For example, human eval has a median length of ~100 tokens.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena/context_length_dist.png" alt="Copilot Arena context length distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4. Context length of files requested in Copilot Arena.</p> <p><strong>Are people biased towards the top completion?</strong> Yes. In fact, 82% of accepted completions were the top completion. We are still analyzing our data, but here are some of our insights.</p> <ul> <li><em>Are people even reading the completions? Or are they just instinctively pressing Tab?</em> Users take a median of 7 seconds to view the response and then select a response. As such, we believe that people are indeed reading the completions.</li> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena/vote_times.png" alt="Copilot Arena Vote time distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5. Distribution of user response times. Most users are taking a few seconds to read the responses.</p> <ul> <li><em>Does position bias affect models equally?</em> Surprisingly, no! For example, when shown as the bottom completion, Sonnet-3.5 is accepted 23.4% of the time compared to only 12.8% of the time for Gemini Flash. On the other hand, they are accepted at roughly the same rate when shown as the top completion (86.7% vs 85% respectively). We are still exploring the reasons behind this phenomenon and will continue our analysis in a future post.</li> </ul> <p><strong>How many people are regular users?</strong> In total, we have had votes from 833 unique users and between 200-250 daily active users.</p> <p><strong>How do you handle ties in Arena?</strong> We do not currently have an option for people to select that both responses are equally good (or bad).</p> <p><strong>How do you handle models pre-trained on FiM?</strong> For Deepseek V2.5 and Codestral, we use their API which directly allows for FiM capabilities.</p> <h2 id="how-do-we-prompt-chat-models-to-perform-code-completions">How Do We Prompt Chat Models to Perform Code Completions?</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena/instruct_error.png" alt="Copilot Arena filetype distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6. (Top) Example of code completion that requires infilling capabilities. (Bottom) Example of formatting issue that chat models encounters when prompted to complete code given the prefix and suffix.</p> <p>During real development processes, developers frequently modify or expand on existing code, rather than only write code in a left-to-right manner. As such, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05999">“fill in the middle”</a> (FiM) capabilities when generating code completions are critical for any models to be used in Copilot Arena. Many code-specific models, including DeepSeek and Codestral, are specifically trained to perform FiM. However, most models in Copilot Arena are not because they are chat models, and thus, they struggle to appropriately format a completion when provided with the prefix and suffix. We explore a simple prompting trick that allows chat models to perform code completions with high success.</p> <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: fit-content;"> <table class="tg"> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th style="text-align: center;">PSM</th> <th style="text-align: center;">SPM</th> <th style="text-align: center;">Mask</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-sonnet</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.67 (+0.16)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.66 (+0.15)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.66 (+0.14)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-2024-08-06</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.71 (+0.02)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.55 (+0.19)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.62 (+0.12)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-mini-2024-07-18</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.18 (+0.39)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.12 (+0.54)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.15 (+0.36)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gemini-1.5-pro-001</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.38 (+0.28)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.34 (+0.36)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.43 (-0.04)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gemini-1.5-flash-001</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.34 (+0.24)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.27 (+0.37)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.36 (+0.19)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.14 (+0.46)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.15 (+0.48)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.12 (+0.27)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Table 2: Percentage of well-formatted code completions with different prompt templates (PSM, SPM, Mask). We denote the gain by our prompting method in parentheses.</p> <p><strong>Evaluation Set-up.</strong> To verify that chat models would indeed struggle to perform FiM, we use the <a href="https://github.com/openai/human-eval-infilling">HumanEval-infilling</a> dataset as an imperfect proxy to benchmark chat models’ FiM capabilities. We adopt three prompt templates considered in prior work (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04814">Gong et al.</a>) like Prefix-suffix-middle (PSM), Suffix-prefix-middle (SPM), and Mask. Instead of measuring pass@1, we only consider whether the returned infilled code is formatted correctly.</p> <p><strong>Chat models can’t naively FiM.</strong> Table 2 shows that standard prompt templates are insufficient for chat models to complete FiM tasks. This is not necessarily an indication that models cannot code as clearly many SOTA chat models are proficient coders. Instead, the vast majority of the errors resulted from issues in formatting or duplicate code segments rather than logical errors, indicating that these models cannot generalize their code outputs to FiM tasks. While it is not feasible to retrain these models, we explore alternative approaches via prompting to enable models to complete FiM tasks.</p> <p><strong>Our solution significantly reduces formatting errors.</strong> Instead of forcing chat models to output code in a format unaligned with its training (e.g. FiM), we allow the model to generate code snippets, which is a more natural format, and then post-process them into a FiM completion. Our approach is as follows: in addition to the same prompt templates above, the models are provided with instructions to begin by re-outputting a portion of the prefix and similarly end with a portion of the suffix. We then match portions of the output code in the input and delete the repeated code. As you can see in Table 2, the models make much fewer formatting issues. These benefits hold regardless of the prompt template.</p> <h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3> <ul> <li><strong>More results and analyses:</strong> We’re working on adding new metrics that will provide more insight into how useful models are (e.g., code persistence), and more fine-grain analyses to understand why some models are preferred by users over others. We will also release a leaderboard for inline editing once we have collected enough votes!</li> <li><strong>Opportunities to contribute to Copilot Arena:</strong> While our initial prompting efforts are proving to be usable in practice, we welcome suggestions for prompt improvements.

This raises the question: which model is best for a specific use-case? To offer deeper insights into this question, we have been adding various categories to our leaderboard. Over time, we’ve introduced a wide array of categories, including hard prompts, instruction-following, math prompts, coding prompts, refusal handling, longer queries, multi-turn conversations, various languages, and style control. Today, we’re excited to announce the release of a new category: creative writing!</p> <p>In this blog post, we’ll explain:</p> <ul> <li>Key insights from our categorical analysis, including how the topic distribution varies with time</li> <li>The deployment process for new categories</li> <li>The definition of each category currently in Chatbot Arena</li> <li>How the community can contribute to improve and add categories</li> </ul> <h2 id="why-categorize">Why Categorize?</h2> <p>Language models don’t shine equally in different areas. Some tasks may require the precise execution of instructions, while others push the model’s ability to reason through complex math problems or handle long, multi-turn conversations. By grouping tasks into categories, we can assess models’ strengths and weaknesses in a more granular way. We acknowledge that a high-ranking on the overall leaderboard doesn’t imply the model will excel across the board in every situation.

Unlike straightforward writing tasks, creative writing prompts involve originality, artistic expression, and often, a different kind of thinking compared to more technical prompts. For instance, while “write a thank-you email” wouldn’t qualify as creative writing, “write a humorously sarcastic thank-you email” would. The category encompasses traditional creative formats (stories, poems, lyrics) and extends to areas like joke creation, meme explanation, and responses to philosophical questions that can’t be answered through simple fact-checking.</p> <p>We note that this category is in a sense, orthogonal, to our previously introduced categories, such as Math and Coding. As such, we find interesting differences in rankings when looking at creative writing. Studying categories like creativity is important— the ranking signal on this type of prompts are innately dependent on human preference, and are difficult to obtain from traditional close-ended benchmarks without human-in-the-loop.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/creative_prompt_diff_1.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1: Ranking deltas from Overall Leaderboard to Creative Writing Leaderboard.</p> <h2 id="defining-and-assigning-the-categories">Defining and assigning the categories</h2> <p>So, how is the creative writing category created? It all starts with the definition. A category can be thought of as a grouping of prompts based on the common skills required to respond effectively. Categories can be well defined (e.g. prompts longer than 500 tokens) or more ambiguous. One prompt could also be classified with multiple categories. Consider the “creative” category— how can we even define prompts that require creativity? In the following sections, we will walk you through how we construct a category in Chatbot Arena.</p> <p>First, we define each category with a checklist. If enough items in the checklist are satisfied, the prompt is labeled as an element of that category. For “Creative Writing” that checklist looks like this:</p> <p>What qualifies as creative writing?</p> <ul> <li>Prompts requiring originality and imagination</li> <li>Tasks involving emotional or artistic expression</li> <li>Requests for unique perspectives or interpretative responses</li> <li>Writing that goes beyond factual reporting or analysis</li> </ul> <p>We include example creative writing prompts in the Appendix <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>. Additionally we also detail the definitions of other categories, including Math, Hard Prompt, Instruction-Following, Code, and various languages in the Appendix <a href="#more-category-definitions">link</a>.</p> <p>Defining categories is one thing—deploying them at scale is another. With over 2 million prompts, category classification cannot be done by hand. While some categories (eg. Language, Code) can use heuristic algorithms for fast classification, others (eg. Creative Writing, Hard Prompt) cannot. For categories like Creative Writing, we build a fast and robust category classification system using an LLM. We prompt the LLM with the category checklist, and judge whether the prompt satisfies the checklist.</p> <p>Of course, it is crucial to verify whether the classifications made by the LLM judge are within the desired specifications. To do this we check the classification performance on a wide sample of Chatbot Arena prompts. As a whole, we call this auto-evaluation pipeline Label Bench, which we define in detail below.</p> <h3 id="label-bench">Label Bench</h3> <p>The Label Bench framework is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Initial Prompt Design: An prototype system prompt is carefully crafted based on a determined definition of the category. Extensive manual testing should be conducted to ensure the system prompt is high-quality.</li> <li>Ground Truth Labeling: Random sample 2000-5000 battles from Chatbot Arena. Employing one or multiple strong LLMs (eg. Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to annotate ground truth labels for each battle. A manual check can be conducted to ensure reasonable accuracy.</li> <li>Optimization: Employ a smaller, open-source model for classification. Remove any COT in the system prompt for additional inference speed up. Verification: Evaluate the smaller classifier against the ground truth labels on the sample battles. We typically iterate until reaching a high precision and recall.</li> <li>Deploy: The best classifier and optimal system prompt are chosen to label the entire Chatbot Arena dataset.</li> </ol> <p>For example, when developing our new creative writing category using the Label Bench framework, we found that with no CoT, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct classified the prompts with 96.1% accuracy (precision: 66.7%, recall: 96.6%) with respect to high-quality labels generated by GPT-4o-mini with CoT. We also cross check this classifier against labels generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet with COT. After ensuring its performance, we deployed this scalable LLM for the final labeling of our 2 million battle prompts.</p> <p>After data labeling, we can compute the Chatbot Arena leaderboard only on the subset of Arena battles labeled as belonging to the category in order to produce a category-specific leaderboard.</p> <h2 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h2> <p>With the groundwork of category creation completed, we can now delve into the meaningful results: statistical trends, categorical correlations, and insights into models’ strengths and weaknesses.</p> <h3 id="categories-over-time">Categories over Time</h3> <p>Are people asking harder questions as LLMs become better? We found the answer is <strong>yes</strong>! The percentage of Hard Prompts, Instruction-Following, Coding, and Math prompts has been increasing since Chatbot Arena’s launch back in April 2023.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/timeseries.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2: Percentage of Chatbot Arena Battles belonging to each category over time.</p> <p>The data also reveals some interesting seasonal variations in prompt complexity. For example, we observe an increase in the percentage of hard prompts during the school year, when students may be asking difficult homework-related questions.</p> <h3 id="relationships-between-categories">Relationships between categories</h3> <p>One way to assess the relationship between categories is to compare their leaderboards. Similar categories may have similar leaderboards. In this subsection we compare the leaderboards of different categories via their Kendall rank correlations.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/kendall_technical_cluster.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3: Kendall Rank Correlations between Chatbot Arena Leaderboards (Task-specific Categories). Similar leaderboards are clustered together. SC means Style Control.</p> <p>Figure 3 reports the Kendall correlations. First, technical leaderboards (Coding, Math, and Hard Prompt) tend to be more correlated with one another compared with Creative Writing. Secondly, consistent with the fact that it is a mixture of them all, the overall leaderboard is moderately correlated with all categories. The highest-correlation category with the overall leaderboard is Instruction-Following. Finally, it is worth mentioning that all these correlations are relatively high; the differences between categories are on the smaller side, although not insignificant.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/kendall_language_cluster.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4. Kendall Rank Correlations between Chatbot Arena Leaderboards (Language Categories). Similar leaderboards are clustered together. SC means Style Control.</p> <p>Above Figure 4 reports the Kendall correlation between different languages. Latin based languages exhibit higher correlations with one another. Chinese is most highly correlated with Japanese. Korean exhibits weaker correlations with the other languages.</p> <h2 id="model-insights">Model Insights</h2> <p>Now that we’ve examined the broad relationships between categories, let’s dive deeper into how individual models perform across different tasks. Understanding these performance patterns is crucial for both users and developers, as it reveals the specialized strengths and potential limitations of each model. By analyzing win-rates across categories and comparing models with similar overall performance, we can uncover nuanced insights that might be obscured in the overall leaderboard rankings.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/o1_mini_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5. o1 Mini’s win-rate conditioned on categories as fitted using a standard decision tree algorithm. Blue indicates o1 Mini wins more often while orange means o1 Mini loses. The selected battles are o1 mini against other models with similar performances (grok-2-2024-08-13, gemini-1.5-pro-002, o1-preview, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, gpt-4o-2024-05-13, chatgpt-4o-latest-20240903).</p> <p>In Figure 5, we observed o1 Mini’s win-rate conditioned on specific categories, providing a visual map of its strengths and weaknesses. In math and hard prompts, o1 Mini performs significantly better, indicated by the blue half of the decision tree. On the other hand, o1 Mini struggles on creative writing when compared to other models.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/gemini-1.5-pro-2_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6. Gemini-1.5-Pro-002’s win-rate conditioned on categories as fitted using a standard decision tree algorithm. The selected battles are Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 against top Chatbot Arena models (o1-preview, o1-mini, chatgpt-4o-latest-20240903, claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620, yi-lightning).</p> <p>Unlike o1-mini, Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 demonstrates exceptional performance on creative writing compared to other top models, as illustrated in Figure 6. However, its performance on coding tasks remains a notable weakness.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/yi-lightning_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 7. Yi-Lightning’s win-rate conditioned on categories as fitted using a standard decision tree algorithm. The selected battles are Yi-Lightning against top Chatbot Arena models (o1-mini, gemini-1.5-pro-002, gpt-4o-2024-05-13, claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620, glm-4-plus).</p> <p>Our analysis of Yi-Lightning, a recent state-of-the-art Chinese LLM, also shows interesting performance patterns. As shown in Figure 7, Yi-Lightning excels at handling complex prompts but shows relatively weaker performance in following basic instructions compared to other top models. Notably, when instruction-following tasks incorporate creative elements, Yi-Lightning’s performance improves.</p> <h2 id="community-contribution">Community Contribution</h2> <p>Want to see another category on the leaderboard?

Let’s push the boundaries and make Chatbot Arena the best it can be!</p> <h2 id="acknowledgment">Acknowledgment</h2> <p>We thank <a href="https://fireworks.ai/">Fireworks AI</a> for their fast open model endpoint supports.</p> <h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2> <h3 id="more-category-definitions">More Category Definitions</h3> <p>We now go into detail on other categories and the checklists we used to define them.</p> <h3 id="hard-prompt">Hard Prompt</h3> <p>Hard Prompt category features user-submitted prompts from the Arena that are specifically designed to be more complex, demanding, and rigorous. Carefully curated, these prompts test the capabilities of the latest language models, providing valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses in tackling challenging tasks.</p> <p>What are the important criteria for a prompt to be “Hard”?</p> <ul> <li>Specificity: Being specific, well-defined, and without ambiguity.</li> <li>Domain Knowledge: Tests the AI’s knowledge and understanding in a specific domain or set of domains.</li> <li>Complexity: Has multiple levels of reasoning, components, or variables.</li> <li>Problem-Solving: Requires active problem-solving: analyzing and clearly defining the problem and systematically devising and implementing a solution.</li> <li>Creativity: Involves a level of creativity when approaching the problem.</li> <li>Technical Accuracy: Requires a high degree of technical accuracy, correctness and precision.</li> <li>Real-world Application: Relates to real-world applications.</li> </ul> <p>For more information, refer to the released blog dedicated to the Hard Prompt category <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/hard-prompts/">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="math">Math</h3> <p>Mathematics evaluation focuses on a model’s ability to actively apply mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Contrary to prompts that merely seek explanations of mathematical concepts, these prompts require direct mathematical computation or logical deduction.</p> <p>Mathematical Prompts:</p> <ul> <li>Requires active application of mathematical concepts</li> <li>Involves some sorts of numerical calculations or algebraic manipulations or geometrical reasoning</li> <li>Contains clear, well-defined, and objective problems</li> <li>Tests one or multiple mathematical competencies</li> </ul> <p>For example, “Explain what a derivative is” wouldn’t qualify as a math prompt, but “Find the derivative of f(x) = x³ + 2x² - 5x + 3” would. For more examples, see Appendix <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="instruction-following">Instruction-Following</h3> <p>This category evaluates a model’s ability to precisely follow given instructions, particularly focusing on multi-step tasks and specific requirements. Similar to the Hard Prompt category’s emphasis on specificity and technical accuracy, instruction-following prompts zoom in on assessing the AI’s capability to execute directions with precision and completeness. The category focuses specifically on the model’s ability to understand and execute detailed instructions rather than on domain knowledge or problem-solving capabilities.</p> <p>Instruction-following prompts include:</p> <ul> <li>Clear, actionable instructions from the user</li> <li>Specific formatting or structural requirements for the response</li> <li>Unique or challenging aspects that would test the AI’s ability to follow directions precisely</li> </ul> <p>For example, while “write about dogs” wouldn’t qualify as an instruction-following prompt, “Write a 3-paragraph description of dogs, using exactly 5 adjectives per paragraph, and conclude with a bulleted list of 3 care tips” would. For more examples, see <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="coding">Coding</h3> <p>The coding category evaluates a model’s capability to understand, generate, and debug code across different programming languages and paradigms. Unlike the previous categories, we employ a heuristic algorithm to classify coding prompts.</p> <p>Our Coding Classifier looks for:</p> <ul> <li>Code blocks in prompt and responses</li> <li>Programming language names and keywords</li> <li>Code commands and other miscellaneous items</li> </ul> <p>While traditional coding benchmarks target specific tasks (such as code editing or algorithm implementation), Chatbot Arena’s coding category encompasses all code-related activities. Taking advantage of its open-ended nature, we evaluate models on complex, multi-layered software engineering tasks. For example, a prompt like “Help me build a professional website using TypeScript” assesses LLMs not only on code generation but also on broader software development decision-making capabilities. For more examples, see Appendix <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="languages">Languages</h3> <p>Each language category assesses a model’s proficiency in responding to prompts within the language. Many Chatbot Arena users engage with LLMs in languages beyond English, testing models on their versatility, linguistic precision, and cultural context in many languages.</p> <p>We tag each prompt with a language tag using <a href="https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Polyglot</a>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/lang_histogram.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 8. Number of Chatbot Arena battles in each of the current set of language categories.</p> <h3 id="style-control">Style Control</h3> <p>Answer style indeed has a strong effect on models’ performance on Chatbot Arena leaderboard. Certain model could be favored because it includes a lot of details when responding or uses heavy markdowns to make its responses appear nicer to human voters. To address this, we develop Style Control as a way to separate the effect of answer style from the content, so you can observe both effects individually.</p> <p>We dedicated an entire blog for style control: please check it out here <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/style-control/">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="others">Others</h3> <p>We also include a number of other categories, many of which are self-explanatory. As a few examples, we include</p> <ul> <li>Exclude Refusal: Excludes all battles where one or more LLM refused to respond. We currently identify refusals via simple keyword matching (eg. “I can’t assist”).</li> <li>Multi-turn: Conversations with multiple turns.</li> <li>Long queries: Queries longer than 500 tokens (approximately 10% of all prompts).</li> <li>Short queries: Queries shorter than 5 tokens. These queries tend to be trivial (e.g. “Hello”).</li> </ul> <h3 id="additional-model-insights">Additional Model Insights</h3> <p>Below we present strengths and weaknesses decision trees for GPT-4o-mini and Claude-3.5-Sonnet.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/gpt-4o-mini_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 9.

These training processes can cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. How can we know whether to trust an LLM judge or reward model, given its critical role in guiding LLM training?</p> <p>We introduce a benchmark to solve this problem: PPE, a collection of 16,038 labeled human preference pairs from Chatbot Arena containing responses from 20 different top LLMs and over 121 languages as well as a dataset of 2,555 prompts, each with 32 different sampled response options, totaling 81,760 responses across 4 different models, all grounded with verifiable correctness labels. PPE evaluates reward models on 12 different metrics and 12 different domains, such as their accuracy in selecting human-preferred or verifiably correct responses.</p> <p>To summarize:</p> <ol> <li>We curate high quality ground truth preference pairs from Chatbot Arena battles as well as existing verifiable correctness benchmarks.</li> <li>We experimentally correlate metrics on each benchmark to downstream RLHF-ed LLMs.</li> <li>We fully open-source PPE, the resulting comprehensive benchmark for reward models with metrics directly linked to downstream RLHF outcomes.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <embed src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/ppe_image.svg" type="image/svg+xml" style="width:100%; height:auto;"/> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 1: Human preference scores on two different metrics use by PPE: Accuracy and Spearman correlation. We notice that the two metrics appear to measure different aspects of the preference proxy. Accuracy may be better for tasks that rank individual responses (like training). Spearman correlation may be better for tasks that rank models (like evaluation). See the later section <i>Studying the Correlation of PPE with Downstream Performance</i> for details on how various metrics correlate to RLHF outcomes. Note: LLM judges in the figure use the Arena-Hard judge prompt.</sub></p> <p> </p> <p>Our code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/lmarena/PPE">Github</a>.</p> <p>Our paper is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14872">Arxiv</a>.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1> <p>Sourcing high quality, unbiased ground truth preference labels is challenging. One common technique is to use LLM judge preference labels followed by human verification; however, this introduces bias. Another technique involves creating synthetic data by generating perturbations of a gold-standard output, which again introduces bias. These preference pairs are not representative of the distribution of responses seen by reward models when providing learning signals for RLHF.</p> <p>Our methodology directly grounds preference labels in real user feedback. We propose two methodologies: (1) Utilize crowdsourced diverse prompts and responses with human preference labels from Chatbot Arena. (2) Utilize existing benchmarks with verifiable correctness checks on LLM-generated responses.</p> <p>The first methodology provides an unbiased estimate of real-world human preference by aggregating many diverse human preferences. We use a large crowdsourced preference set of 16,038 preference labels to mitigate individual label noise and avoid over-fitting to any single individual’s preference.</p> <p>The second methodology curates an objective correctness signal. We use the second approach to label the correctness of many sampled responses from an LLM, mimicking rollouts or best-of-k exploration strategies seen in RLHF training processes. As a result, we draw preference pairs from more naturally occurring distributions (e.g. real LLM responses and errors), that better align with the expected environment reward models operate in.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="human-preference">Human Preference</h1> <p>To measure whether alignment with human preference directly, we utilize a dataset collected from Chatbot Arena. The human preference dataset contains human-labeled preferences for 16,038 pairwise comparisons between 20 selected top models.</p> <p>Since the human preference set is crowdsourced from Chatbot Arena, we can repeat the collection process at any time to obtain an updated set that better reflects the current array of available models and any changes in human preference.</p> <p>The human preference dataset, at a glance, includes:</p> <ol> <li> <p>4,583 instruction-following prompts, 5,195 hard prompts, 2,564 math prompts. Prompts may exist in multiple categories.</p> </li> <li> <p>User queries from over 121 languages. Top languages include English (8,842), Chinese (1,823), Russian (1,779), German (568), Korean (338), Japanese (321), etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>A diverse array of prompt categories: Hard, Easy, Math, Instruction following, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Preferences crowdsourced from 6,120 individuals.</p> </li> </ol> <p>See Appendix <a href="#human-preference-metrics">Human Preference Metrics</a> for model scores.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="correctness-preference">Correctness Preference</h1> <p>We measure a preference model’s ability to distinguish between similar responses and resistance to reward-hacking by using correctness metrics based on benchmarks with verifiable ground truths. We selected five reliable benchmarks: MMLU Pro, MATH, GPQA, MBPP Plus, and IFEval, ensuring that each provides a clear, verifiable correctness signal. This approach is flexible, allowing any benchmark with a verifiable ground truth to be added.</p> <p>In total, the correctness preference set contains:</p> <ol> <li> <p>2,555 prompts and 32 sampled responses per prompt, totaling 81,760 total responses.</p> </li> <li> <p>A binary correctness label for each response.</p> </li> <li> <p>Responses from Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9b-it, Claude-3-Haiku, and GPT-4o-mini.</p> </li> </ol> <p>See Appendix <a href="#correctness-preference-metrics">Correctness Preference Metrics</a> for model scores.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="validating-post-rlhf-llm-outcomes">Validating post-RLHF LLM outcomes</h1> <p>We aim to see how well PPE predict the performance of reward models in training LLMs. To do this, we RLHF-tune a base LLM using several reward models and evaluate the resulting LLMs by measuring real-world human preference (Arena Scores). The experiment uses Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, with RLHF via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Results are collected from 12,190 human votes in Chatbot Arena, and final Arena Scores depend solely on the reward model used.</p> <p>We selected nine reward models based on popularity and performance. We built a dataset of 8,000 prompts and 128,000 model responses collected from the base model from which each reward model picked a preferred response per prompt, creating a training set of “chosen” and “rejected” responses. Using DPO, we trained Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for each reward model to assess downstream real-world human preference.</p> <p>We deployed our trained DPO models to Chatbot Arena for real-world human evaluation. These models were paired against each other for blind comparison. A total of 12,190 votes were collected, averaging 2,032 battles per model and 190 battles per unique model pair. The resulting Arena Scores, calculated using the Bradley-Terry model, are detailed in Appendix <a href="#post-rlhf-arena-scores">Post-RLHF Arena Scores</a>, highlighting the downstream RLHF performance of each reward model based on human preferences.</p> <h1 id="studying-the-correlation-of-ppe-with-downstream-performance">Studying the Correlation of PPE with Downstream Performance</h1> <p><a id="figure2"></a> <img src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/MainHeatmaps.png" style="width:100%; height:auto; text-align: center;"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 2: Pearson correlations of different metrics toward downstream human preference. Left: Pearson correlation between the ranking of models on 5 specific benchmarks and 5 different metrics and their respective post-DPO Arena Score rankings on real human preference. Right: Pearson correlation between the ranking of models on 7 categories and 7 metrics on the Human Preference Dataset.</sub></p> <p><a id="figure3"></a> <img src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/RewardBenchHeatmap.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%; height: auto;"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 3: Pearson correlation between the ranking of models in RewardBench and their respective post-DPO Arena Score rankings on real human preference.</sub></p> <p>On correctness metrics (left plot in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>) we make several observations: (1) Mean across all domains is well correlated across all metrics, but exhibits higher correlation with AUC and Accuracy scores. (2) Math is the best individual benchmark domain in terms of predictive power. (3) ROC AUC score draws higher correlation across all benchmarks, even on benchmarks that are otherwise uncorrelated.</p> <p>Turning to the right-hand side of <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>, the accuracy of the reward model is the best predictor of the fine-tuned LLM’s preference score. Row-wise Pearson Correlation, Confidence Agreement, and Separability show some correlative power to downstream scores but do not exceed accuracy. Meanwhile, metrics like the Spearman correlation and Kendall correlation have nearly zero correlation with the final Arena Scores achieved by the post-DPO models. One possible reason for this trend is that accuracy measures expected preference correctness per preference pair— a much more granular scale. Other metrics involve aggregating reward model signals over higher-order preferences, such as preference for each model, as measured by correlation metrics. We consider these metrics as low granularity. Medium granularity metrics, such as Row-wise Pearson Correlation aggregate reward model signal, but do so over smaller subsets of preferences.</p> <p>Overall, accuracy on the human preference dataset is more correlated than the correctness metrics. This is because correctness and human preference do not necessarily align. Moreover, the information contained in Loss, Max score, and End score may not prove relevant in DPO, which is off-policy. Those employing RLHF algorithms that have a higher risk of over-optimization may find these alternative measures helpful. However, when calculating correlation against style controlled Arena Scores<sup>*</sup> we notice a slight decrease in correlations on the human preference dataset. Notably, the correctness preference measurements show no change, suggesting correctness preference may be more robust towards reward model preference quality, response style aside. Style-controlled correlation heatmaps are shown in Appendix <a href="#style-control">Style Control</a>.</p> <p><sup>*</sup> Style controlled Arena Scores are calculated as detailed in our previous blog, <a href="/blog/2024/style-control/"><em>Does Style Matter?</em></a></p> <p>  <a id="figure4"></a> <img src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/AggregationPlots.png" style="width:100%; height:auto"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 4: Spearman Correlation, Confidence Agreement, and Accuracy metrics: For each metric, we take the quantiles of category scores (Hard, Easy, Instruction Following, Coding, Math, and Similar). The Pearson Correlation is calculated relative to Post-RLHF Human Preference Arena Score ratings for each quantile. Notably, accuracy peaks at 0.80 correlation at low quantile aggregation.</sub></p> <p> </p> <p>Additionally, we observe that measuring the lower bound score may correlate more to downstream RLHF performance than the average score or upper bound score. In <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>, we first re-scale each category’s scores to be mean 0 and SD 1, then we vary the quantile of the aggregation strategy across human preference dataset categories (Hard Prompts, Easy Prompts, etc). In this case, the 0 quantile is the minimum, and the 1 quantile is the maximum. We find that in nearly every metric, decreasing the quantile increases correlation with downstream Arena Scores. We posit this represents the requirement that reward models be robust under all input distributions to mitigate reward-hacking. Any domain weakness in a reward model can be exploited by the LLM during training.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <p>PPE is another step towards rigorous evaluations of reward models and LLM-Judges before deployment to expensive model training and evaluation pipelines. For reward models specifically, we take extra care to ensure that PPE correlates to downstream RLHF-ed LLM performance. Moreover, PPE is a natural framework in which to evaluate LLM judges. We reasoned that a well-aligned LLM judge should be able to reconstruct the preferences we have sourced with high fidelity. For example, LLM judges used for automatic evaluation should be able to rank models in the human preference set with high confidence and correlation. LLM judges used to replicate individual human preferences should do so at high accuracy, just like reward models. Moving forward, we seek to keep creating, updating, and finding new ways in which to ensure that our preference proxy signals are in alignment with our desired outcomes.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="citation">Citation</h1> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@misc{frick2024evaluaterewardmodelsrlhf,

We take the view that LLM agents consist of three components - LLM models (e.g GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.1), frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, etc), and tools (code interpreters, APIs like Brave Search or Yahoo Finance). For example, an agent to summarize an earnings report, might be powered by a GPT-4o model, use PDFReader as tool to read pdf of earnings reports, and be orchestrated by langchain! Agent-arena captures and ranks user-preferences for agents as a unit, and for each of the three sub-components, providing insights to model-developers, tool-developers, and more critically, users of LLM agents!</p> <p>Agents come with many nuances in model and framework evaluation. For example, let’s say I wanted to build a financial assistant that retrieves the top performing stocks of the week.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>❓What model should I use?</strong> One model have been trained on far more financial data 💸, while another may excel in reasoning ♟️ and computation ➗.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>❓ And what about frameworks?</strong> One platform might have more API integrations but another might index the internet better.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>❓ What tools should I use?</strong> Do I need tools that return stock prices 📈 or APIs that can return news 📰 about the market for this specific use-case.</p> </blockquote> <p>As this example illustrates, there is much to think about when designing an agentic workflow - and this is only one use-case out of potentially dozens in the financial domain alone. Different use-cases will call for different combinations of models, tools, and frameworks.</p> <p>We are delighted to release <strong>🤖 Agent Arena</strong>, an interactive sandbox where users can compare, visualize, and rate agentic workflows <strong>personalized to their needs</strong>. Agent Arena allows users to choose from a combinations of tasks, LLM providers, frameworks, tools, etc and also vote on their performance. We enable users to see how different agents perform against each other in a structured and systematic way. By doing this, we believe that users can make more informed decisions regarding their <em>agentic stack</em>. Further, with the Agent Arena we wish to showcase the shortcomings and impressive advacements of the state of agents!</p> <p>Agent Arena also consists of live leaderboard and ranking of LLM models, frameworks, and tools grouped by domain. Additionally, we believe these rankings can help inform model, tooling, and framework developers, helping them understand where they stand on various use-cases and how they can improve. Also recognizing that user-vote based elections are affected by selection-bias, as a new feature, Agent Arena also includes a Prompt Hub, where you can subscribe to specific prompt-experts and see their invidual opinions on various tasks. <strong>You</strong> can also publish your set of prompts!</p> <p>This blog post will look into the key elements of Agent Arena, including the definition of agents, the novel ranking algorithm, model tuning, examples of agent use cases, and a roadmap for future developments. And saving the best for the last, along with this blog, we are also releasing 2,000 real-world, pair-wise agent battles, and user preferences!! We’ll continue to periodically release more battle data!</p> <p><strong>Quick Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Arena:</strong> <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/">Agent-Arena</a></li> <li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/leaderboard">Agent Leaderboard</a></li> <li><strong>User Prompts:</strong> <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/users">Prompt Hub</a></li> <li><strong>Agent Battle Data:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/blob/main/agent-arena/evalutation/agent_ratings_V0.json">Agent Battle Data</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="-what-are-agents">🦜 What are Agents?</h2> <p>In Agent Arena, agents are defined as entities that can perform complex tasks by leveraging various subcomponents. We define each agent to be made up to three components - LLM models, tools, and frameworks. The agents we consider are sourced from established frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, Composio, and assistants provided by OpenAI and Anthropic. Each of these agents may display characteristics such as chain-of-thought reasoning, tool use, and function calling, which enable them to execute complex tasks efficiently. For the platform, we utilized models that support function calling and tool use, which are critical aspects for LLM agents.</p> <p><em>LLM agents leverage various tools like code interpreters and external APIs to enhance their problem-solving abilities and execute complex tasks efficiently</em></p> <p>For example, LangChain and LlamaIndex agents come equipped with specific toolkits that enhance their problem-solving capabilities. OpenAI’s assistants, such as code interpreters and file processing models, also qualify as agents due to their demonstrated ability to interpret code, process files, and call external functions. Anthropic’s agents are integrated with external tools, and similar examples from other frameworks further enhance their utility for specific tasks.</p> <h2 id="the-agent-arena-platform">The Agent Arena Platform</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_agent_arena_flowchart.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2: A high-level overview of agent comparisons based on user goals, models, frameworks, and performance metrics like execution time and ELO</p> <p>At its core, Agent Arena allows for goal-based agent comparisons. On a high level, users will first input a task that they want to accomplish. Then, an LLM automatically assign relevant agents based on the task. These agents are then tasked with completing the goal, with the agent’s actions and <em>chain of thought</em> being streamed to the user in real-time. Once the agents have completed the task, the user can compare the outputs side-by-side and vote on which agent performed better.</p> <p>The evaluation process includes voting on agent performance, with users assessing which agent met the task’s requirements more effectively. This user-driven evaluation contributes to an evolving leaderboard system, which ranks agents based on their relative performance across multiple tasks and competitions. This comparison is not limited to the agents as a whole but extends to the individual components (i.e., LLM models, tools, and frameworks) that comprise each agent.</p> <p>In the sections below, we will look into the core components of Agent Arena, including the router system, execution, evaluation and ranking mechanisms, leaderboard, and prompt hub. We will also explore some example tasks and applications that can be performed on the platform.</p> <h2 id="the-router-system-agent-matching-and-task-assignment">The Router System: Agent Matching and Task Assignment</h2> <p>A central element of Agent Arena is its router system, which is powered by GPT-4o currently. We plan to cycle between all models, and also judge each model’s ability to route prompts to the most relevant agents! The router’s primary function is to match users’ specified goals with the most suitable agents available on the platform.</p> <p>The router operates by analyzing the user’s input (the goal or task) and selects two agents that are optimally suited to complete that task. This selection process factors in the agents’ historical performance across similar tasks, as well as their configurations in terms of models, tools, and frameworks.</p> <p>For example, a user might provide the following: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">input("Tell me about whats going on in NVIDIA in the last week.")</code> The router would then select two suitable options given the available agents and the leaderboard ELOs. For this use-case, the router might select the agent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">agent_a = Agent(model="GPT-4o", tools=["Yahoo Finance", "Matplotlib"], framework="Langchain")</code> to analyze the stock information about NVIDIA. On the other side, to compare against Agent A, the router might select the combination: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">agent_b = Agent(model="Claude", tools=["Yahoo News"], framework="CrewAI")</code> to observe the goal from the perspective of news.</p> <p>This comparison is fruitful because it allows the platform and the user to understand the nuances in the agents’ capabilities and the different ways they can approach the same task. Then, they themselves can vote for which style they like better.</p> <h2 id="evaluation-and-ranking-system">Evaluation and Ranking System</h2> <p>Agent Arena employs a comprehensive ranking system that evaluates agents based on their performance in head-to-head comparisons. The leaderboard ranks agents not only based on their overall performance but also by breaking down the performance of individual components such as LLM models, tools, and frameworks. The ranking process is informed by both user evaluations and an ELO-based rating system, commonly used in competitive ranking environments, where agent performance is dynamically adjusted after each task or comparison.</p> <p>The rating system in Agent Arena is designed to reflect the cumulative performance of agents across a wide range of tasks, taking into account factors such as:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_leaderboard1.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3: The leaderboards analyzing the subcomponents of the agents</p> <ul> <li><strong>Model performance:</strong> Evaluating the effectiveness of the underlying LLM models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.1).</li> <li><strong>Tool efficiency:</strong> Ranking the tools agents use to complete tasks (e.g., code interpreters, APIs like Brave Search or Yahoo Finance).</li> <li><strong>Framework functionality:</strong> Assessing the broader frameworks that support agents, such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI.</li> </ul> <p>Check out the latest rankings for each category on our leaderboard: <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/leaderboard">Agent Arena Leaderboard</a>.</p> <h3 id="️-evaluating-agents-with-the-extended-arena-score">⚖️ Evaluating Agents with the Extended Arena Score</h3> <p>Agent Arena uses the <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/extended-arena/">extended Arena score</a>, which allows us to compare different agents based on their subcomponents, including tools, models, and frameworks. Instead of just evaluating the agents atomically, we also assess the performance of each individual subcomponent. This allows us to more accurately pinpoint where an agent’s strength lies. For example, our first agent could be a combination of LangChain, Brave-Search, and GPT-4o-2024-08-06, while the second agent could be LlamaIndex, Wikipedia, and Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20240620.</p> <p>Therefore, we propose the following observation model for the Extended Arena Score. Given <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P_1</code>,</p> <p>For each battle \(i \in [n]\), we have a prompt and two agents, encoded as the following:</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent A</code>: The first agent being compared with an elo of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E_A</code> and with the subcomponents <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(A_T, A_M, A_F)</code></li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent B</code>: The second agent being compared, having an elo of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E_B</code> and with the subcomponents <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(B_T, B_M, B_F)</code></li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y_i</code>: Outcome of the battle (1 for win, 0 for loss)</li> </ul> <h4 id="-example-langchain-brave-search-agent-vs-llamaindex-wikipedia-agent">🧑‍💻 Example: LangChain Brave-Search Agent vs. LlamaIndex Wikipedia Agent</h4> <p>Let’s walk through an example to illustrate how the Extended Bradley-Terry Model works in practice. Take the following agents and their subcomponents:</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent_A</code> is the LangChain Brave-Search Agent, using the following subcomponents: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ Brave-Search (A_T), LangChain (A_F), and GPT-4o-2024-08-06 (A_M) }</code> and an Elo of 1600.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent B</code> is the LlamaIndex Wikipedia Agent, with the subcomponents: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{Wikipedia (B_T), LlamaIndex (B_F), and Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20240620 (B_M)}</code> and an Elo of 1500.</li> </ul> <p>To get a holistic evaluation of an agent, we combine all its subcomponents into a single analysis. Instead of treating each subcomponent as an isolated entity, we consider their interaction within the broader agent architecture. For each battle, we build a design matrix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> that represents all the subcomponents involved. This allows us to evaluate the collective contribution of the subcomponents (tools, models, frameworks) in a single calculation. We then apply logistic regression with L2 regularization to control for overfitting and confounding effects caused by frequent pairings. By using this combined approach, Agent Arena ensures more accurate rankings across agents and their subcomponents. 🔄 This method provides clearer insights into each agent’s performance and contributions, preventing the bias that can occur from frequent pairings or overused configurations. See the <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/extended-arena/">blog</a> for additional mathematical details!</p> <p>🎉 As a result, our system generates a real-time, continuously updating leaderboard that not only reflects the agents’ overall performance but also their specific subcomponent strengths. 🏆 Check out our live leaderboards for agents, tools, models, and frameworks <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/leaderboard">here</a>!</p> <h2 id="the-prompt-hub">The Prompt Hub</h2> <p>The Agent Arena also comes with a prompt hub that has over 1000+ tasks that have been tested and verified to work on the platform.

Let me try to solve it myself:Question: A 5 kg object is dropped from a height of 10 meters. How long does it take to hit the ground?Thought: To solve this problem, I will use the kinematic equations for a falling object under the influence of gravity.The kinematic equations are:v = u + ats = ut + 0.5at^2Where:v = final velocity (m/s)u = initial velocity (m/s) a = acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s^2)t = time (s)s = displacement (m)Given:- Initial height (s) = 10 m- Mass of object = 5 kg- Initial velocity (u) = 0 m/s (since the object is dropped)- Acceleration due to gravity (a) = -9.8 m/s^2Using the kinematic equations:s = ut + 0.5at^210 = 0t + 0.5(-9.8)t^210 = -4.9t^2t = \u221a(10/4.9) = \u221a2.04 = 1.43 sTherefore, it takes 1.43 seconds for the 5 kg object to hit the ground when dropped from a height of 10 meters.Final Answer: It takes 1.43 seconds for the 5 kg object to hit the ground when dropped from a height of 10 meters.&gt;",

</pre> </details> <p>In education-focused scenarios, LLM agents have the potential to offer rich, step-by-step explanations that guide students through complex problems, such as physics calculations. In the example of determining how long it takes for a 5 kg object to fall from 10 meters, the agents approached the problem using basic equations of motion. However, while Agent A (anthropic calculator tool, claude-3-opus-20240229) provided a thorough breakdown of the solution, the simplicity of its approach highlighted a need for more nuanced handling of kinematics, such as adaptive responses that dynamically adjust based on user queries. Meanwhile, Agent B (langchain Wolfram Alpha, claude-3-haiku-20240307) leveraged Wolfram Alpha but struggled with obtaining relevant data from the tool, indicating gaps in API integration that hinder real-time computational accuracy. These cases show opportunities for fine-tuning the agents’ interaction with APIs and frameworks, ensuring that agents not only retrieve correct data but also process and apply it efficiently to real-world scenarios. Improving the fluidity and depth of these calculations, especially when leveraging multiple APIs, can bring enhanced precision and adaptability in educational contexts, enriching the learning experience and making the agent more capable of handling varied educational queries.</p> <h4 id="business-data-analytics-">Business Data Analytics 💸</h4> <blockquote> <p>“Given this .csv file of last year’s sales data, generate insights of what products to scale up.”</p> </blockquote> <details> <summary>Prompt Execution</summary> <pre>

</pre> </details> <p>In business data analytics, LLM agents can offer valuable insights by processing large datasets, such as CSV files containing sales data, to uncover trends and make strategic recommendations. In this example, Agent A (sql agent plotter langchain, gpt-4o-2024-05-13) struggled with an error, misinterpreting the CSV file as a SQLite database, which highlights limitations in the agent’s error-handling capabilities and its adaptability to different file formats. Although the agent attempted to switch tools and correct the process, it was clear that a more seamless integration between SQL and file-processing tools was needed to maintain workflow fluidity. Meanwhile, Agent B (langchain Pandas DataFrame, gpt-4o-2024-08-06) effectively analyzed the sales data, identifying top-performing products like “Laptop” and “Smartphone” based on sales revenue, and suggested scaling up “Headphones” and “Keyboard” due to high sales volume. However, Agent B could benefit from deeper contextual understanding by linking sales patterns with external factors such as seasonality or promotions. These examples underscore the need for agents to better handle complex datasets, enhance error resilience, and offer more context-aware analysis, especially when switching between tools or working with diverse data formats. Improving these areas would significantly enhance the agent’s ability to deliver more robust, actionable insights, particularly in complex business scenarios.</p> <h4 id="social-media-management--content-creation-">Social Media Management / Content Creation 📸</h4> <blockquote> <p>“Schedule daily Instagram posts for a week, promoting our upcoming sale using relevant hashtags and current influencer trends.”</p> </blockquote> <details> <summary>Prompt Execution</summary> <pre>

As a result, it has been increasingly used, especially in cases of refractory headache pain. Headaches can be classified as primary and secondary and can result from a variety of serious conditions. Types of primary headaches include tension, migraine, and cluster headaches whereas secondary headaches include headaches because of infection or vascular disease, and cervicogenic headaches. Both types can result in serious debility and diminished quality of life. The treatment of chronic headache pain commonly consists of lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and injectable medications. The aim of this study was to investigate the primary and secondary outcomes of RFA for chronic headache pain.METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using three different databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database. The key concepts of \"radiofrequency ablation\" and \"headache\" were used. The search took place in June 2023, and it included articles from the past twenty years.RESULTS: Of the 580 articles found, 32 were included in the review. Most studies focused on pain scores, duration of relief, function, and patient satisfaction. In several studies, RFA was used to target various nerves as the pain generator and compared with modalities such as local anesthetic or corticosteroid.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, RFA shows favorable outcomes in the management of chronic headache pain. Therefore, RFA can serve as an alternative treatment option for patients who fail other conservative treatment regimens. Understanding the outcomes of RFA for headache pain can provide patients and clinicians with evidence for the most appropriate treatment strategies.Published: 2024-06-03Title: New Daily PersistentThought:I have gathered information on two recent studies regarding treatment options for chronic migraines. The first study focuses on the efficacy and safety of erenumab, a preventive therapy for chronic migraine and medication overuse headaches. The second study reviews the use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a treatment for chronic headache pain, indicating it may be a viable option for patients who do not respond to conventional treatments.Final Answer: Recent research suggests that erenumab (administered monthly) is effective for chronic migraines, particularly in patients with medication overuse headaches. Additionally, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is emerging as a promising alternative treatment for chronic headache pain, especially for those who have not found relief with other therapies.&gt; Recent research suggests that erenumab (administered monthly) is effective for chronic migraines, particularly in patients with medication overuse headaches.

Additionally, the response structure failed to account for Instagram’s unique features, such as optimal posting times or Story integration. Meanwhile, the gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 agent provided a decent post schedule but didn’t fully leverage influencer data or real-time trends to inform its content suggestions.</p> <p>These agents, while functional, demonstrate that more specialized frameworks tailored for social media platforms are needed.

</pre> </details> <p>Manually sifting through medical research is not only time-consuming but also leaves room for oversight, particularly when the data spans numerous clinical trials and evolving treatment protocols. LLM agents offer a powerful alternative, adept at combing through extensive medical databases, pulling relevant findings, and connecting them to specific patient conditions. In cases like chronic migraines, an agent can swiftly gather recent studies on effective treatments, such as erenumab, a preventive therapy, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which offers long-term relief for headache pain. For example, in this instance, the langchain PubMed Biomedical Literature Tool (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) agent successfully retrieved relevant research, presenting concrete treatment options based on the latest findings. In contrast, the ArXiv Article Fetcher (claude-3-haiku-20240307) struggled due to ArXiv’s focus on pre-prints, not clinical treatments. Despite this, the fallback recommendations to check more appropriate medical journals like JAMA show how agents can adapt when limitations arise. Enhancing integration with specialized databases and refining multi-step query handling could unlock even more potential, allowing these agents to provide faster, more accurate, and contextually relevant medical recommendations, ultimately pushing the boundaries of how automated systems can support healthcare decisions.</p> <h4 id="sports-data-analytics-">Sports Data Analytics 🏀</h4> <blockquote> <p>“Predict the odds of the Denver Nuggets winning the NBA championship, given individual player statistics, team performance trends, and recent trade news.”</p> </blockquote> <details> <summary>Prompt Execution</summary> <pre>

Individual player statistics and health3. Roster changes and recent trades4. Performance against other top contenders5. Historical playoff performance6. Coaching and team chemistryWithout access to current data on these factors, I can't provide a precise probability estimate. However, I can offer some general insights:The Nuggets won the NBA championship in 2023, so they have recent championship experience. Key players like Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray have proven they can perform at an elite level in high-pressure playoff situations.Their odds would likely be among the favorites, but exact probabilities would depend on:- How they're performing this season compared to other top teams- If their core players are healthy- Any significant roster changes since last season- How they've fared against other top contendersTo give a more accurate prediction, I'd need up-to-date information on their record, player stats, and standing relative to other top teams in the current NBA season. Detailed analysis of game data and advanced statistics would also be required for a data-driven probability estimate.If you have any specific current data points about the Nuggets or the NBA landscape this season, I'd be happy to incorporate that into a more tailored assessment. Otherwise, this general framework outlines the key factors that would shape their championship odds.",

</pre> </details> <p>In sports data analytics, LLM agents are tasked with analyzing player statistics, team performance, and trade news to predict outcomes, like the Denver Nuggets’ chances of winning the NBA championship. Agent A (langchain google-serper search agent, open-mixtral-8x22b) gathered relevant data but lacked the depth of analysis needed for a precise prediction, missing key insights like player injuries or competition from other teams. Similarly, Agent B (anthropic web page reader, claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620) emphasized the importance of real-time data but couldn’t provide a detailed, data-driven prediction due to the absence of current season statistics.</p> <p>Both agents highlight the need for better integration of real-time data sources and more advanced statistical modeling. Improving how these agents handle multi-step reasoning and predictive analytics would significantly enhance their ability to deliver accurate, actionable insights, making them more useful for teams, analysts, and sports bettors who depend on such forecasts for decision-making.</p> <h4 id="trip-planning-️">Trip Planning ✈️</h4> <blockquote> <p>“Plan a day trip to Carmel-by-the-Sea from San Francisco.

</pre> </details> <p>In travel planning, LLM agents have the potential to craft detailed itineraries by optimizing routes and suggesting relevant stops along the way. In the example of planning a day trip from San Francisco to Carmel-by-the-Sea, Agent A (crewai AI Crew for Trip Planning, gemini-1.5-pro-002) and Agent B (langchain google-serper search agent, open-mixtral-8x22b) both suggested fuel-efficient routes and popular attractions. However, while Agent B efficiently identified major landmarks and provided a clear route, the responses lacked dynamic adjustments based on real-time conditions like traffic or road closures.</p> <p>Additionally, Agent A struggled with more seamless transitions between tools, which affected the ability to fully integrate relevant trip data. These examples point to areas where enhancing real-time API integration and improving the agents’ adaptability to changing travel conditions could provide more tailored and accurate trip plans. Better handling of dynamic factors like current road conditions or user-specific preferences would result in richer, more relevant travel experiences.</p> <h2 id="next-steps-and-project-roadmap">Next Steps and Project Roadmap</h2> <p>We have an exciting roadmap ahead for Agent Arena, with several initiatives planned to both enhance and expand the platform’s capabilities. We envision that the agent arena will become a central hub for both agent developers and providers.</p> <p>For developers and users interested in building/using agents, the platform will be a sandbox for them to perfect their agentic stack, with the right providers and frameworks tailored to their use-cases</p> <p>By providing a systematic way to run agents, compare them against each other, view advanced analytics for providers based on their use-case, and even view the prompts of similar users, we hope to deliver value to the agent-building community.</p> <p>To reach this vision, we have laid out a comprehensive roadmap of feature development and improvement. The general theme of these changes will be to improve the personalization of the arena to individual users along with expanding the available analytics.</p> <h3 id="-increasing-the-number-of-llm--framework-providers-on-the-platform">📈 Increasing the Number of LLM &amp; Framework Providers on the Platform</h3> <p>One of the primary goals of the Agent Arena is to show users all of the combinations of agents that they can build, so they can definitely know which options are the best suited for their use-cases. While we currently offer the main providers in each category, we hope to expand our selection to include more niche providers that are specialized in certain tasks.</p> <h3 id="-incorporating-user-personalization">🧑‍💻 Incorporating User Personalization</h3> <p>In order to make the platform as useful as possible, we want to ensure that users are met with specific recommendations on the latest releases and agents that are best suited for their use-cases. This will involve us learning their preferences in their providers and output formats, enabling us to then recommend the best agents for them.</p> <h3 id="-enabling-multi-turn-prompts">🪜 Enabling multi-turn prompts</h3> <p>Most agentic tasks involve multiple steps of reasoning and action from the agent. This requires keeping track of the state of the context of the task. For example, take the following task:</p> <blockquote> <p>Task: “Search for the top 5 performing stocks this year in the S&amp;P 500 and then find the latest news about them.”</p> </blockquote> <p>This task requires the agent to first find the top 5 stocks, keep it somewhere in backend ‘memory’,and then call another set of individual tools to find the latest news about them. This is a multi-turn prompt, and other examples can start to involve 5+ steps. We plan on releasing this feature in the upcoming few months for users.</p> <h3 id="️️-expanding-the-capabilities-of-the-platform">🏋️‍♀️ Expanding the Capabilities of the Platform</h3> <p>The current implementation of the platform has left several domains of agent use-cases unexplored. More specifically, we hope to start integrating with APIs like Jira, Github, GSuite and other tools to enable users to actually run agents on their personal data. While this will involve a lot of security and privacy considerations, we believe this is a critical step in making the platform more useful to users.</p> <h3 id="-improving-the-recommendation-algorithm">📊 Improving the Recommendation Algorithm</h3> <p>Based on user preferences and the providers/frameworks they like, we plan on improving the routing of goals to more relevant agents for the user. Additionally, we will include two different modes of routing: one that is more exploratory and one that is more focused on the user’s preferences.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Agent Arena is a platform to evaluate and compare LLM agents. By offering a comprehensive ranking system and tools to test agents from various frameworks, the platform allows users to make informed decisions about the best models and tools for their specific needs. With continuous improvements and expansions planned, Agent Arena is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of LLM agent evaluation.</p> <p>We invite researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts to explore Agent Arena, contribute to its growth, and help shape the future of agent-based AI systems. Together, we can push the boundaries of what’s possible with LLM agents and unlock new potentials in AI-driven problem-solving.</p> <h2 id="citation">Citation</h2> <p>We hope you enjoyed this blog post.

Recently, we have developed some extensions of the Bradley-Terry model, and the closely related Elo model, for the purpose of binary-comparison inference problems. Our extensions target the case where each of the two players in the comparison may contain more than one subsystem that contributes to their strength. We will develop these extensions in the batch form (Extended Bradley-Terry) and in the online form (Extended Elo).</p> <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2> <p>Let \(\ell : [0,1] \times \{0,1\} \to \mathbb{R}\) denote the binary cross-entropy loss, where the first argument is the predicted probability, and the second argument is the ground-truth binary outcome. As a reminder, for a prediction \(\hat{y} \in [0,1]\) and a binary label \(y \in \{0,1\}\), the binary cross-entropy loss is defined as</p> \[\ell(\hat{y}, y) = -y \log(\hat{y}) - (1-y) \log(1-\hat{y}).\] <p>Furthermore, let \(M_{A}, M_{B} \in \mathbb{N}\), \(d_{m_{A}, -1}, d_{m_B, 1} \in \mathbb{N}\) for all \(m_{A} \in [M_{A}]\) and \(m_B \in [M_B]\), and \(d_{\rm total} = \sum\limits_{m_{A} \in [M_{A}]} d_{m_{A}, A} + \sum\limits_{m_{B} \in [M_{B}]} d_{m_{B}, B}\). Next, define the set</p> \[\mathcal{X} = \{ x \in \{-1, 0, 1\}^{d_{\rm total}} : | \{j : x_j = -1 \} | = M_{A} \text{ and } | \{j : x_j = 1 \} | = M_{B}\}.\] <p>That is, \(\mathcal{X}\) is the set of vectors of length \(d_{\rm total}\) with \(M_{A}\) entries equal to \(-1\), \(M_{B}\) entries equal to \(1\), and the rest equal to \(0\). The interpretation is that we have \(M_A\) subsystems for player \(A\) and \(M_B\) subsystems for player \(B\), and the feature vector \(x \in \mathcal{X}\) encodes which subsystems are active in the current battle. The active subsystems for player \(A\) are those with \(-1\), and the active subsystems for player \(B\) are those with \(1\). Then, with \(\sigma\) as the sigmoid function, the extended Bradley-Terry model postulates that the probability that player \(B\) beats player \(A\) is given by</p> \[\mathbb{P}(B \text{ beats } A) = \sigma(x^{\top} \theta^*),\] <p>for some (unknown) parameter vector \(\theta^* \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\rm total}}\).</p> <p>As in the standard Bradley-Terry model, this parameter vector can be expressed as the solution to a logistic regression:</p> \[\theta^* = \arg\min\limits_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\rm total}}} \mathbb{E}_{(X,Y) \sim P}\left[ \ell(\sigma(X^\top \theta), Y) \right],\] <p>where \(P\) is some joint distribution over \(\mathcal{X} \times \{0,1\}\). The standard Bradley-Terry model is recovered when \(M_A=M_B=1\). As a side note, we normally report these coefficients after multiplying them by \(400\) and adding \(1000\), so that the coefficients are in the same range as the Elo ratings in chess. This is a purely cosmetic transformation and does not affect the model’s predictions.</p> <h2 id="extended-arena-score">Extended Arena Score</h2> <p>To estimate \(\theta^*\) given a sample \((X_1,Y_1), \ldots, (X_n,Y_n)\), we calculate the population logistic regression solution,</p> \[\hat\theta = \arg\min\limits_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\rm total}}} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \ell(\sigma(X_i^\top \theta), Y_i) + \lambda \|\theta\|_p,\] <p>where \(\lambda \geq 0\) is a regularization parameter and \(\|\cdot\|_p\) is the \(\ell_p\) norm (most commonly, we take \(p=1\) or \(p=2\)). The regularization term is used to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the solution is unique, especially when the number of samples is small and the solution may not be unique.</p> <h2 id="extended-online-arena-score">Extended Online Arena Score</h2> <p>The Extended Arena Score from the previous section handles the batch setting, where all the samples are available at once, and they come i.i.d. from a distribution \(P\). However, in many applications, the samples arrive sequentially, and we would like to update our estimate of \(\theta^*\) as new samples arrive from a possibly changing distribution. This is the online setting, and we can use the Extended Online Arena Score to update our estimate of \(\theta^*\) as new samples arrive. The Extended Online Arena Score amounts to running online logistic regression on the same feature set. The algorithm is as follows:</p> \[\theta^{(t+1)} = \theta^{(t)} - \eta \nabla \ell(\sigma(X_t^\top \theta^{(t)}), Y_t) - \lambda \nabla \|\theta^{(t)}\|\_p,\] <p>where \(\eta &gt; 0\) is the learning rate, and \(\nabla \|\cdot\|_p\) is any valid subgradient of the \(\ell_p\) norm. The benefit, and drawback, of the online score is that it never converges. When the distribution of the samples is changing, the online score will adapt to the new distribution, while the batch score will not. However, the online score will not converge to the true \(\theta^*\), while the batch score will, when such a \(\theta^*\) exists.</p> <h2 id="uses-of-these-extensions">Uses of these Extensions</h2> <p>These extensions have been used in a handful of recent projects, including the <a href="http://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/redteam-arena/">RedTeam Arena</a> project, where we use the online variant to jointly rank models, target phrases, and players; and the <a href="http://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/agent-arena/">Agent Arena</a> project, where we use the batch version to jointly rank models, tools, frameworks, and agents.</p> <h2 id="citation">Citation</h2> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@misc{angelopoulos2024statistical,

The first game we created is called <em><a href="https://redarena.ai">Bad Words</a></em>, challenging players to convince models to say target “bad words”. It already has strong community adoption, with thousands of users participating and competing for the top spot on the jailbreaker leaderboard.</p> <p>We plan to open the data after a short responsible disclosure delay. We hope this data will help the community determine the boundaries of AI models—how they can be controlled and convinced.</p> <p>This is not a bug bounty program, and it is not your grandma’s jailbreak arena. Our goal is to serve and grow the redteaming community. To make this one of the most massive crowdsourced red teaming initiatives of all time. From our perspective, models that are easily persuaded are not worse: they are just more controllable, and less resistant to persuasion. This can be good or bad depending on your use-case; it’s not black-and-white.</p> <p>We need your help. Join our jailbreaking game at <a href="https://redarena.ai">redarena.ai</a>.

Leaderboard screenshot. Latest version at <a href="https://redarena.ai/leaderboard">redarena.ai/leaderboard</a></p> <p>People have been asking how we compute the leaderboard of players, models, and prompts. The idea is to treat every round of Bad Words as a 1v1 game between a player and a (prompt, model) combination, and calculate the corresponding Elo score. Doing this naively is sample-inefficient and would result in slow convergence, so we instead designed a new statistical method for this purpose (writeup coming!) and we’ll describe it below.</p> <p><em>Observation model.</em> Let \(T\) be the number of battles (“time-steps”), \(M\) be the number of models, \(P\) be the number of players, and \(R\) be the number of prompts. For each battle \(i \in [n]\), we have a player, a model, and a prompt, encoded as following:</p> <ul> <li>\(X_i^{\rm Model} \in \{0,1\}^M\), a one-hot vector with 1 on the entry of the model sampled in battle \(i\).</li> <li>\(X_i^{\rm Player} \in \{0,1\}^P\), a one-hot vector with 1 on the entry of the player in battle \(i\).</li> <li>\(X_i^{\rm Prompt} \in \{0,1\}^R\), a one-hot vector with 1 on the entry of the prompt sampled in battle \(i\).</li> <li>\(Y_i \in \{0,1\}\), a binary outcome taking the value 1 if the player won (or forfeited) and 0 otherwise.</li> </ul> <p>We then compute the <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/extended-arena/">Extended Online Arena Score</a>, with the feature \(X_i\) being the concatenation of \(X_i^{\rm Model}\), \(X_i^{\rm Player}\), and \(X_i^{\rm Prompt}\), and the label \(Y_i\) being the outcome of battle \(i\).</p> <p>That’s it! After updating the model coefficients in this way, we report them in the tables in the <a href="https://redarena.ai/leaderboard">RedTeam Arena</a>.</p> <h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2> <p><a href="https://redarena.ai">RedTeam Arena</a> is a community-driven project, and we’re eager to grow it further with your help!

Consider models A and B. Model A is great at producing code, factual and unbiased answers, etc., but it outputs short and terse responses. Model B is not so great on substance (e.g., correctness), but it outputs great markdown, and gives long, detailed, flowery responses. Which is better, model A, or model B?</p> <p>The answer is not one dimensional. Model A is better on substance, and Model B is better on style. Ideally, we would have a way of teasing apart this distinction: capturing how much of the model’s Arena Score is due to substance or style.</p> <p>Our methodology is a first step towards this goal. We explicitly model style as an independent variable in our Bradley-Terry regression. For example, we added length as a feature—just like each model, the length difference has its <em>own</em> Arena Score! By doing this, we expect that the Arena Score of each model will reflect its strength, controlled for the effect of length.</p> <p>Please read below for the technical details. We also controlled not just for length, but also a few other style features. As a first version, we propose controlling</p> <ol> <li>Answer token length</li> <li>Number of markdown headers</li> <li>Number of markdown bold elements</li> <li>Number of markdown lists</li> </ol> <p>We publicly release our data with vote and style elements and code on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19VPOril2FjCX34lJoo7qn4r6adgKLioY#scrollTo=dYANZPG_8a9N">google colab</a>! You can try out experimenting with style control now. More improvements to come, and please reach out if you want to help contribute!</p> <p><strong>Background.</strong> To produce the results above, we controlled for the effect of style by adding extra “style features” into our Bradley-Terry regression. This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlling_for_a_variable">standard technique</a> in statistics, and has been recently used in LLM evaluations [1]. Additionally, there are studies suggesting potential bias for “pretty” and more detailed responses in humans [2, 3]. The idea is that, by including any confounding variables (e.g. response length) in the regression, we can attribute any increase in strength to the confounder, as opposed to the model. Then, the Bradley-Terry coefficient will be more reflective of the model’s intrinsic ability, as opposed to possible confounders. The definition of a confounder is to some extent up to our interpretation; as our style features, we use the (normalized) difference in response lengths, the number of markdown headers, and the number of lists.</p> <p>More formally, consider vectors \(X_1, \ldots, X_n \in \mathbb{R}^M\) and \(Y_1, \ldots, Y_n \in \{0,1\}\), where \(n\) is the number of battles and \(M\) is the number of models.</p> <p>For every \(i \in [n]\), We have that \(X_{i,m}=1\) only if model \(m \in [M]\) is the model shown in the left-hand side in Chatbot Arena, and \(X_{i,m}=-1\) only if it is shown on the right. That is, \(X_i\) is a vector with two nonzero elements. The outcome \(Y_i\) takes the value \(Y_i=1\) if the left-hand model wins, and \(Y_i=0\) otherwise.</p> <p>The standard method for computing the Arena Score (i.e., the Bradley-Terry coefficients, which we formerly called the Elo score) is to run a logistic regression of \(Y_i\) onto \(X_i\). That is, for every model \(m\), we associate a scalar \(\hat{\beta}_m\) that describes its strength, and the vector \(\hat{\beta}\) is determined by solving the following logistic regression:</p> \[\hat{\beta} = \arg \min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^M} \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathsf{BCELoss}(\mathsf{sigmoid}(X_i^\top \beta), Y_i)\] <p>where \(\mathsf{BCELoss}\) represents the binary cross-entropy loss. (In practice, we also reweight this objective to handle non-uniform model sampling, but let’s ignore that for now.)</p> <h2 id="style-control">Style Control</h2> <p>Now, for every battle \(i \in [n]\), let’s say that in addition to \(X_i\) that we observe some additional style features, \(Z_i \in \mathbb{R}^S\). These style features can be as simple or complicated as you want. For example, \(Z_i\) could just be the difference in response lengths of the two models, in which case \(S=1\). Or, we could have \(S&gt;1\) and include other style-related features, for example, the number of markdown headers, common words associated with refusal, or even style features that are automatically extracted by a model!</p> <p>Here, we define each style feature as \begin{equation} \text{normalize }\left(\frac{\text{feature}_A - \text{feature}_B}{\text{feature}_A + \text{feature}_B}\right) \end{equation}</p> <p>For example, the first new feature, token length difference between answer A and answer B, would be expressed as \begin{equation} \text{normalize }\left(\frac{\text{length}_A - \text{length}_B}{\text{length}_A + \text{length}_B}\right) \end{equation}</p> <p>We divide the difference by the sum of both answers’ token length to make the length difference proportional to the pairwise answer token lengths. An answer with 500 tokens is roughly equal in length to an answer with 520 tokens, while an answer with 20 tokens is very different from an answer with 40 tokens, even though the difference is 20 tokens for both scenarios. Alternatively, AlpacaEval LC uses the following normalization technique.</p> <p>\begin{equation} \tanh\left(\frac{\text{feature}_A - \text{feature}_B)}{\sigma(\text{feature}_A - \text{feature}_B)}\right). \end{equation}</p> <p>The idea of style control is very basic. We perform the same logistic regression as before, but with some extra, additive style coefficients: \(\hat{\beta}, \hat{\gamma} = \arg \min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^M, \gamma \in \mathbb{R}^S} \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathsf{BCELoss}(\mathsf{sigmoid}(X_i^\top \beta + Z_i^{\top}\gamma), Y_i).\) We refer to the results \(\hat{\beta}\) and \(\hat{\gamma}\) as the “model coefficients” and the “style coefficients” respectively. The model coefficients have the same interpretation as before; however, they are controlled for the effect of style, which is explicitly modeled by the style coefficients!</p> <p>When the style coefficients are big, that means that the style feature has a big effect on the response. To define “big”, you need to properly normalize the style coefficients so they can be compared. All in all, when analyzing the style coefficients, we found that length was the dominant style factor. All other markdown effects are second order.</p> <p>We report the following coefficient for each style attribute across different methods of controlling the style.</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"> <tr> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;"></th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Length</th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Markdown List</th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Markdown Header</th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Markdown Bold</th> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Control Both</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.249</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.031</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.024</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.019</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Control Markdown Only</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.111</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.044</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.056</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Control Length Only</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.267</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> </tr> </table> <h2 id="ablation">Ablation</h2> <p>Next, we compare the ranking changes between controlling for answer length only, markdown element only, and both.

Although controlling for style is a big step forward, our analysis is still <em>observational</em>. There are possible unobserved confounders such as positive correlation between length and substantive quality that are <em>not</em> accounted for by our study. For example, well-known example of a possible unobserved confounder that might positively impact both length and quality is a chain-of-thought explanation for a reasoning question.</p> <p>To address these limitations, we are looking forward to implementing <em>causal inference</em> in our pipeline, and running prospective randomized trials to assess the effect of length, markdown, and more. Our pipeline for style control will be changing as we continue to improve our system and refine the analysis.
