This raises the question: which model is best for a specific use-case? To offer deeper insights into this question, we have been adding various categories to our leaderboard. Over time, we’ve introduced a wide array of categories, including hard prompts, instruction-following, math prompts, coding prompts, refusal handling, longer queries, multi-turn conversations, various languages, and style control. Today, we’re excited to announce the release of a new category: creative writing!</p> <p>In this blog post, we’ll explain:</p> <ul> <li>Key insights from our categorical analysis, including how the topic distribution varies with time</li> <li>The deployment process for new categories</li> <li>The definition of each category currently in Chatbot Arena</li> <li>How the community can contribute to improve and add categories</li> </ul> <h2 id="why-categorize">Why Categorize?</h2> <p>Language models don’t shine equally in different areas. Some tasks may require the precise execution of instructions, while others push the model’s ability to reason through complex math problems or handle long, multi-turn conversations. By grouping tasks into categories, we can assess models’ strengths and weaknesses in a more granular way. We acknowledge that a high-ranking on the overall leaderboard doesn’t imply the model will excel across the board in every situation. Categories help elucidate these nuances, allowing our users to identify which models are best suited for their specific needs.</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Table 1.

Unlike straightforward writing tasks, creative writing prompts involve originality, artistic expression, and often, a different kind of thinking compared to more technical prompts. For instance, while “write a thank-you email” wouldn’t qualify as creative writing, “write a humorously sarcastic thank-you email” would. The category encompasses traditional creative formats (stories, poems, lyrics) and extends to areas like joke creation, meme explanation, and responses to philosophical questions that can’t be answered through simple fact-checking.</p> <p>We note that this category is in a sense, orthogonal, to our previously introduced categories, such as Math and Coding. As such, we find interesting differences in rankings when looking at creative writing. Studying categories like creativity is important— the ranking signal on this type of prompts are innately dependent on human preference, and are difficult to obtain from traditional close-ended benchmarks without human-in-the-loop.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/creative_prompt_diff_1.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1: Ranking deltas from Overall Leaderboard to Creative Writing Leaderboard.</p> <h2 id="defining-and-assigning-the-categories">Defining and assigning the categories</h2> <p>So, how is the creative writing category created? It all starts with the definition. A category can be thought of as a grouping of prompts based on the common skills required to respond effectively. Categories can be well defined (e.g. prompts longer than 500 tokens) or more ambiguous. One prompt could also be classified with multiple categories. Consider the “creative” category— how can we even define prompts that require creativity? In the following sections, we will walk you through how we construct a category in Chatbot Arena.</p> <p>First, we define each category with a checklist. If enough items in the checklist are satisfied, the prompt is labeled as an element of that category. For “Creative Writing” that checklist looks like this:</p> <p>What qualifies as creative writing?</p> <ul> <li>Prompts requiring originality and imagination</li> <li>Tasks involving emotional or artistic expression</li> <li>Requests for unique perspectives or interpretative responses</li> <li>Writing that goes beyond factual reporting or analysis</li> </ul> <p>We include example creative writing prompts in the Appendix <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>. Additionally we also detail the definitions of other categories, including Math, Hard Prompt, Instruction-Following, Code, and various languages in the Appendix <a href="#more-category-definitions">link</a>.</p> <p>Defining categories is one thing—deploying them at scale is another. With over 2 million prompts, category classification cannot be done by hand. While some categories (eg. Language, Code) can use heuristic algorithms for fast classification, others (eg. Creative Writing, Hard Prompt) cannot. For categories like Creative Writing, we build a fast and robust category classification system using an LLM. We prompt the LLM with the category checklist, and judge whether the prompt satisfies the checklist.</p> <p>Of course, it is crucial to verify whether the classifications made by the LLM judge are within the desired specifications. To do this we check the classification performance on a wide sample of Chatbot Arena prompts. As a whole, we call this auto-evaluation pipeline Label Bench, which we define in detail below.</p> <h3 id="label-bench">Label Bench</h3> <p>The Label Bench framework is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Initial Prompt Design: An prototype system prompt is carefully crafted based on a determined definition of the category. Extensive manual testing should be conducted to ensure the system prompt is high-quality.</li> <li>Ground Truth Labeling: Random sample 2000-5000 battles from Chatbot Arena. Employing one or multiple strong LLMs (eg. Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to annotate ground truth labels for each battle. A manual check can be conducted to ensure reasonable accuracy.</li> <li>Optimization: Employ a smaller, open-source model for classification. Remove any COT in the system prompt for additional inference speed up. Verification: Evaluate the smaller classifier against the ground truth labels on the sample battles. We typically iterate until reaching a high precision and recall.</li> <li>Deploy: The best classifier and optimal system prompt are chosen to label the entire Chatbot Arena dataset.</li> </ol> <p>For example, when developing our new creative writing category using the Label Bench framework, we found that with no CoT, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct classified the prompts with 96.1% accuracy (precision: 66.7%, recall: 96.6%) with respect to high-quality labels generated by GPT-4o-mini with CoT. We also cross check this classifier against labels generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet with COT. After ensuring its performance, we deployed this scalable LLM for the final labeling of our 2 million battle prompts.</p> <p>After data labeling, we can compute the Chatbot Arena leaderboard only on the subset of Arena battles labeled as belonging to the category in order to produce a category-specific leaderboard.</p> <h2 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h2> <p>With the groundwork of category creation completed, we can now delve into the meaningful results: statistical trends, categorical correlations, and insights into models’ strengths and weaknesses.</p> <h3 id="categories-over-time">Categories over Time</h3> <p>Are people asking harder questions as LLMs become better? We found the answer is <strong>yes</strong>! The percentage of Hard Prompts, Instruction-Following, Coding, and Math prompts has been increasing since Chatbot Arena’s launch back in April 2023.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/timeseries.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2: Percentage of Chatbot Arena Battles belonging to each category over time.</p> <p>The data also reveals some interesting seasonal variations in prompt complexity. For example, we observe an increase in the percentage of hard prompts during the school year, when students may be asking difficult homework-related questions.</p> <h3 id="relationships-between-categories">Relationships between categories</h3> <p>One way to assess the relationship between categories is to compare their leaderboards. Similar categories may have similar leaderboards. In this subsection we compare the leaderboards of different categories via their Kendall rank correlations.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/kendall_technical_cluster.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3: Kendall Rank Correlations between Chatbot Arena Leaderboards (Task-specific Categories). Similar leaderboards are clustered together. SC means Style Control.</p> <p>Figure 3 reports the Kendall correlations. First, technical leaderboards (Coding, Math, and Hard Prompt) tend to be more correlated with one another compared with Creative Writing. Secondly, consistent with the fact that it is a mixture of them all, the overall leaderboard is moderately correlated with all categories. The highest-correlation category with the overall leaderboard is Instruction-Following. Finally, it is worth mentioning that all these correlations are relatively high; the differences between categories are on the smaller side, although not insignificant.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/kendall_language_cluster.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4. Kendall Rank Correlations between Chatbot Arena Leaderboards (Language Categories). Similar leaderboards are clustered together. SC means Style Control.</p> <p>Above Figure 4 reports the Kendall correlation between different languages. Latin based languages exhibit higher correlations with one another. Chinese is most highly correlated with Japanese. Korean exhibits weaker correlations with the other languages.</p> <h2 id="model-insights">Model Insights</h2> <p>Now that we’ve examined the broad relationships between categories, let’s dive deeper into how individual models perform across different tasks. Understanding these performance patterns is crucial for both users and developers, as it reveals the specialized strengths and potential limitations of each model. By analyzing win-rates across categories and comparing models with similar overall performance, we can uncover nuanced insights that might be obscured in the overall leaderboard rankings.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/o1_mini_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5. o1 Mini’s win-rate conditioned on categories as fitted using a standard decision tree algorithm. Blue indicates o1 Mini wins more often while orange means o1 Mini loses. The selected battles are o1 mini against other models with similar performances (grok-2-2024-08-13, gemini-1.5-pro-002, o1-preview, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, gpt-4o-2024-05-13, chatgpt-4o-latest-20240903).</p> <p>In Figure 5, we observed o1 Mini’s win-rate conditioned on specific categories, providing a visual map of its strengths and weaknesses. In math and hard prompts, o1 Mini performs significantly better, indicated by the blue half of the decision tree. On the other hand, o1 Mini struggles on creative writing when compared to other models.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/gemini-1.5-pro-2_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6. Gemini-1.5-Pro-002’s win-rate conditioned on categories as fitted using a standard decision tree algorithm. The selected battles are Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 against top Chatbot Arena models (o1-preview, o1-mini, chatgpt-4o-latest-20240903, claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620, yi-lightning).</p> <p>Unlike o1-mini, Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 demonstrates exceptional performance on creative writing compared to other top models, as illustrated in Figure 6. However, its performance on coding tasks remains a notable weakness.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/yi-lightning_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 7. Yi-Lightning’s win-rate conditioned on categories as fitted using a standard decision tree algorithm. The selected battles are Yi-Lightning against top Chatbot Arena models (o1-mini, gemini-1.5-pro-002, gpt-4o-2024-05-13, claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620, glm-4-plus).</p> <p>Our analysis of Yi-Lightning, a recent state-of-the-art Chinese LLM, also shows interesting performance patterns. As shown in Figure 7, Yi-Lightning excels at handling complex prompts but shows relatively weaker performance in following basic instructions compared to other top models. Notably, when instruction-following tasks incorporate creative elements, Yi-Lightning’s performance improves.</p> <h2 id="community-contribution">Community Contribution</h2> <p>Want to see another category on the leaderboard?

Let’s push the boundaries and make Chatbot Arena the best it can be!</p> <h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2> <h3 id="more-category-definitions">More Category Definitions</h3> <p>We now go into detail on other categories and the checklists we used to define them.</p> <h3 id="hard-prompt">Hard Prompt</h3> <p>Hard Prompt category features user-submitted prompts from the Arena that are specifically designed to be more complex, demanding, and rigorous. Carefully curated, these prompts test the capabilities of the latest language models, providing valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses in tackling challenging tasks.</p> <p>What are the important criteria for a prompt to be “Hard”?</p> <ul> <li>Specificity: Being specific, well-defined, and without ambiguity.</li> <li>Domain Knowledge: Tests the AI’s knowledge and understanding in a specific domain or set of domains.</li> <li>Complexity: Has multiple levels of reasoning, components, or variables.</li> <li>Problem-Solving: Requires active problem-solving: analyzing and clearly defining the problem and systematically devising and implementing a solution.</li> <li>Creativity: Involves a level of creativity when approaching the problem.</li> <li>Technical Accuracy: Requires a high degree of technical accuracy, correctness and precision.</li> <li>Real-world Application: Relates to real-world applications.</li> </ul> <p>For more information, refer to the released blog dedicated to the Hard Prompt category <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/hard-prompts/">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="math">Math</h3> <p>Mathematics evaluation focuses on a model’s ability to actively apply mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Contrary to prompts that merely seek explanations of mathematical concepts, these prompts require direct mathematical computation or logical deduction.</p> <p>Mathematical Prompts:</p> <ul> <li>Requires active application of mathematical concepts</li> <li>Involves some sorts of numerical calculations or algebraic manipulations or geometrical reasoning</li> <li>Contains clear, well-defined, and objective problems</li> <li>Tests one or multiple mathematical competencies</li> </ul> <p>For example, “Explain what a derivative is” wouldn’t qualify as a math prompt, but “Find the derivative of f(x) = x³ + 2x² - 5x + 3” would. For more examples, see Appendix <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="instruction-following">Instruction-Following</h3> <p>This category evaluates a model’s ability to precisely follow given instructions, particularly focusing on multi-step tasks and specific requirements. Similar to the Hard Prompt category’s emphasis on specificity and technical accuracy, instruction-following prompts zoom in on assessing the AI’s capability to execute directions with precision and completeness. The category focuses specifically on the model’s ability to understand and execute detailed instructions rather than on domain knowledge or problem-solving capabilities.</p> <p>Instruction-following prompts include:</p> <ul> <li>Clear, actionable instructions from the user</li> <li>Specific formatting or structural requirements for the response</li> <li>Unique or challenging aspects that would test the AI’s ability to follow directions precisely</li> </ul> <p>For example, while “write about dogs” wouldn’t qualify as an instruction-following prompt, “Write a 3-paragraph description of dogs, using exactly 5 adjectives per paragraph, and conclude with a bulleted list of 3 care tips” would. For more examples, see <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="coding">Coding</h3> <p>The coding category evaluates a model’s capability to understand, generate, and debug code across different programming languages and paradigms. Unlike the previous categories, we employ a heuristic algorithm to classify coding prompts.</p> <p>Our Coding Classifier looks for:</p> <ul> <li>Code blocks in prompt and responses</li> <li>Programming language names and keywords</li> <li>Code commands and other miscellaneous items</li> </ul> <p>While traditional coding benchmarks target specific tasks (such as code editing or algorithm implementation), Chatbot Arena’s coding category encompasses all code-related activities. Taking advantage of its open-ended nature, we evaluate models on complex, multi-layered software engineering tasks. For example, a prompt like “Help me build a professional website using TypeScript” assesses LLMs not only on code generation but also on broader software development decision-making capabilities. For more examples, see Appendix <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="languages">Languages</h3> <p>Each language category assesses a model’s proficiency in responding to prompts within the language. Many Chatbot Arena users engage with LLMs in languages beyond English, testing models on their versatility, linguistic precision, and cultural context in many languages.</p> <p>We tag each prompt with a language tag using <a href="https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Polyglot</a>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/lang_histogram.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 8. Number of Chatbot Arena battles in each of the current set of language categories.</p> <h3 id="style-control">Style Control</h3> <p>Answer style indeed has a strong effect on models’ performance on Chatbot Arena leaderboard. Certain model could be favored because it includes a lot of details when responding or uses heavy markdowns to make its responses appear nicer to human voters. To address this, we develop Style Control as a way to separate the effect of answer style from the content, so you can observe both effects individually.</p> <p>We dedicated an entire blog for style control: please check it out here <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/style-control/">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="others">Others</h3> <p>We also include a number of other categories, many of which are self-explanatory. As a few examples, we include</p> <ul> <li>Exclude Refusal: Excludes all battles where one or more LLM refused to respond. We currently identify refusals via simple keyword matching (eg. “I can’t assist”).</li> <li>Multi-turn: Conversations with multiple turns.</li> <li>Long queries: Queries longer than 500 tokens (approximately 10% of all prompts).</li> <li>Short queries: Queries shorter than 5 tokens. These queries tend to be trivial (e.g. “Hello”).</li> </ul> <h3 id="additional-model-insights">Additional Model Insights</h3> <p>Below we present strengths and weaknesses decision trees for GPT-4o-mini and Claude-3.5-Sonnet.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/gpt-4o-mini_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 9.

These training processes can cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. How can we know whether to trust an LLM judge or reward model, given its critical role in guiding LLM training?</p> <p>We introduce a benchmark to solve this problem: PPE, a collection of 16,038 labeled human preference pairs from Chatbot Arena containing responses from 20 different top LLMs and over 121 languages as well as a dataset of 2,555 prompts, each with 32 different sampled response options, totaling 81,760 responses across 4 different models, all grounded with verifiable correctness labels. PPE evaluates reward models on 12 different metrics and 12 different domains, such as their accuracy in selecting human-preferred or verifiably correct responses.</p> <p>To summarize:</p> <ol> <li>We curate high quality ground truth preference pairs from Chatbot Arena battles as well as existing verifiable correctness benchmarks.</li> <li>We experimentally correlate metrics on each benchmark to downstream RLHF-ed LLMs.</li> <li>We fully open-source PPE, the resulting comprehensive benchmark for reward models with metrics directly linked to downstream RLHF outcomes.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <embed src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/ppe_image.svg" type="image/svg+xml" style="width:100%; height:auto;"/> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 1: Human preference scores on two different metrics use by PPE: Accuracy and Spearman correlation. We notice that the two metrics appear to measure different aspects of the preference proxy. Accuracy may be better for tasks that rank individual responses (like training). Spearman correlation may be better for tasks that rank models (like evaluation). See the later section <i>Studying the Correlation of PPE with Downstream Performance</i> for details on how various metrics correlate to RLHF outcomes. Note: LLM judges in the figure use the Arena-Hard judge prompt.</sub></p> <p> </p> <p>Our code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/lmarena/PPE">Github</a>.</p> <p>Our paper is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14872">Arxiv</a>.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1> <p>Sourcing high quality, unbiased ground truth preference labels is challenging. One common technique is to use LLM judge preference labels followed by human verification; however, this introduces bias. Another technique involves creating synthetic data by generating perturbations of a gold-standard output, which again introduces bias. These preference pairs are not representative of the distribution of responses seen by reward models when providing learning signals for RLHF.</p> <p>Our methodology directly grounds preference labels in real user feedback. We propose two methodologies: (1) Utilize crowdsourced diverse prompts and responses with human preference labels from Chatbot Arena. (2) Utilize existing benchmarks with verifiable correctness checks on LLM-generated responses.</p> <p>The first methodology provides an unbiased estimate of real-world human preference by aggregating many diverse human preferences. We use a large crowdsourced preference set of 16,038 preference labels to mitigate individual label noise and avoid over-fitting to any single individual’s preference.</p> <p>The second methodology curates an objective correctness signal. We use the second approach to label the correctness of many sampled responses from an LLM, mimicking rollouts or best-of-k exploration strategies seen in RLHF training processes. As a result, we draw preference pairs from more naturally occurring distributions (e.g. real LLM responses and errors), that better align with the expected environment reward models operate in.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="human-preference">Human Preference</h1> <p>To measure whether alignment with human preference directly, we utilize a dataset collected from Chatbot Arena. The human preference dataset contains human-labeled preferences for 16,038 pairwise comparisons between 20 selected top models.</p> <p>Since the human preference set is crowdsourced from Chatbot Arena, we can repeat the collection process at any time to obtain an updated set that better reflects the current array of available models and any changes in human preference.</p> <p>The human preference dataset, at a glance, includes:</p> <ol> <li> <p>4,583 instruction-following prompts, 5,195 hard prompts, 2,564 math prompts. Prompts may exist in multiple categories.</p> </li> <li> <p>User queries from over 121 languages. Top languages include English (8,842), Chinese (1,823), Russian (1,779), German (568), Korean (338), Japanese (321), etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>A diverse array of prompt categories: Hard, Easy, Math, Instruction following, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Preferences crowdsourced from 6,120 individuals.</p> </li> </ol> <p>See Appendix <a href="#human-preference-metrics">Human Preference Metrics</a> for model scores.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="correctness-preference">Correctness Preference</h1> <p>We measure a preference model’s ability to distinguish between similar responses and resistance to reward-hacking by using correctness metrics based on benchmarks with verifiable ground truths. We selected five reliable benchmarks: MMLU Pro, MATH, GPQA, MBPP Plus, and IFEval, ensuring that each provides a clear, verifiable correctness signal. This approach is flexible, allowing any benchmark with a verifiable ground truth to be added.</p> <p>In total, the correctness preference set contains:</p> <ol> <li> <p>2,555 prompts and 32 sampled responses per prompt, totaling 81,760 total responses.</p> </li> <li> <p>A binary correctness label for each response.</p> </li> <li> <p>Responses from Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9b-it, Claude-3-Haiku, and GPT-4o-mini.</p> </li> </ol> <p>See Appendix <a href="#correctness-preference-metrics">Correctness Preference Metrics</a> for model scores.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="validating-post-rlhf-llm-outcomes">Validating post-RLHF LLM outcomes</h1> <p>We aim to see how well PPE predict the performance of reward models in training LLMs. To do this, we RLHF-tune a base LLM using several reward models and evaluate the resulting LLMs by measuring real-world human preference (Arena Scores). The experiment uses Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, with RLHF via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Results are collected from 12,190 human votes in Chatbot Arena, and final Arena Scores depend solely on the reward model used.</p> <p>We selected nine reward models based on popularity and performance. We built a dataset of 8,000 prompts and 128,000 model responses collected from the base model from which each reward model picked a preferred response per prompt, creating a training set of “chosen” and “rejected” responses. Using DPO, we trained Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for each reward model to assess downstream real-world human preference.</p> <p>We deployed our trained DPO models to Chatbot Arena for real-world human evaluation. These models were paired against each other for blind comparison. A total of 12,190 votes were collected, averaging 2,032 battles per model and 190 battles per unique model pair. The resulting Arena Scores, calculated using the Bradley-Terry model, are detailed in Appendix <a href="#post-rlhf-arena-scores">Post-RLHF Arena Scores</a>, highlighting the downstream RLHF performance of each reward model based on human preferences.</p> <h1 id="studying-the-correlation-of-ppe-with-downstream-performance">Studying the Correlation of PPE with Downstream Performance</h1> <p><a id="figure2"></a> <img src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/MainHeatmaps.png" style="width:100%; height:auto; text-align: center;"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 2: Pearson correlations of different metrics toward downstream human preference. Left: Pearson correlation between the ranking of models on 5 specific benchmarks and 5 different metrics and their respective post-DPO Arena Score rankings on real human preference. Right: Pearson correlation between the ranking of models on 7 categories and 7 metrics on the Human Preference Dataset.</sub></p> <p><a id="figure3"></a> <img src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/RewardBenchHeatmap.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%; height: auto;"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 3: Pearson correlation between the ranking of models in RewardBench and their respective post-DPO Arena Score rankings on real human preference.</sub></p> <p>On correctness metrics (left plot in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>) we make several observations: (1) Mean across all domains is well correlated across all metrics, but exhibits higher correlation with AUC and Accuracy scores. (2) Math is the best individual benchmark domain in terms of predictive power. (3) ROC AUC score draws higher correlation across all benchmarks, even on benchmarks that are otherwise uncorrelated.</p> <p>Turning to the right-hand side of <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>, the accuracy of the reward model is the best predictor of the fine-tuned LLM’s preference score. Row-wise Pearson Correlation, Confidence Agreement, and Separability show some correlative power to downstream scores but do not exceed accuracy. Meanwhile, metrics like the Spearman correlation and Kendall correlation have nearly zero correlation with the final Arena Scores achieved by the post-DPO models. One possible reason for this trend is that accuracy measures expected preference correctness per preference pair— a much more granular scale. Other metrics involve aggregating reward model signals over higher-order preferences, such as preference for each model, as measured by correlation metrics. We consider these metrics as low granularity. Medium granularity metrics, such as Row-wise Pearson Correlation aggregate reward model signal, but do so over smaller subsets of preferences.</p> <p>Overall, accuracy on the human preference dataset is more correlated than the correctness metrics. This is because correctness and human preference do not necessarily align. Moreover, the information contained in Loss, Max score, and End score may not prove relevant in DPO, which is off-policy. Those employing RLHF algorithms that have a higher risk of over-optimization may find these alternative measures helpful. However, when calculating correlation against style controlled Arena Scores<sup>*</sup> we notice a slight decrease in correlations on the human preference dataset. Notably, the correctness preference measurements show no change, suggesting correctness preference may be more robust towards reward model preference quality, response style aside. Style-controlled correlation heatmaps are shown in Appendix <a href="#style-control">Style Control</a>.</p> <p><sup>*</sup> Style controlled Arena Scores are calculated as detailed in our previous blog, <a href="/blog/2024/style-control/"><em>Does Style Matter?</em></a></p> <p>  <a id="figure4"></a> <img src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/AggregationPlots.png" style="width:100%; height:auto"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 4: Spearman Correlation, Confidence Agreement, and Accuracy metrics: For each metric, we take the quantiles of category scores (Hard, Easy, Instruction Following, Coding, Math, and Similar). The Pearson Correlation is calculated relative to Post-RLHF Human Preference Arena Score ratings for each quantile. Notably, accuracy peaks at 0.80 correlation at low quantile aggregation.</sub></p> <p> </p> <p>Additionally, we observe that measuring the lower bound score may correlate more to downstream RLHF performance than the average score or upper bound score. In <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>, we first re-scale each category’s scores to be mean 0 and SD 1, then we vary the quantile of the aggregation strategy across human preference dataset categories (Hard Prompts, Easy Prompts, etc). In this case, the 0 quantile is the minimum, and the 1 quantile is the maximum. We find that in nearly every metric, decreasing the quantile increases correlation with downstream Arena Scores. We posit this represents the requirement that reward models be robust under all input distributions to mitigate reward-hacking. Any domain weakness in a reward model can be exploited by the LLM during training.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <p>PPE is another step towards rigorous evaluations of reward models and LLM-Judges before deployment to expensive model training and evaluation pipelines. For reward models specifically, we take extra care to ensure that PPE correlates to downstream RLHF-ed LLM performance. Moreover, PPE is a natural framework in which to evaluate LLM judges. We reasoned that a well-aligned LLM judge should be able to reconstruct the preferences we have sourced with high fidelity. For example, LLM judges used for automatic evaluation should be able to rank models in the human preference set with high confidence and correlation. LLM judges used to replicate individual human preferences should do so at high accuracy, just like reward models. Moving forward, we seek to keep creating, updating, and finding new ways in which to ensure that our preference proxy signals are in alignment with our desired outcomes.</p> <p> </p> <h1 id="citation">Citation</h1> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@misc{frick2024evaluaterewardmodelsrlhf,

We take the view that LLM agents consist of three components - LLM models (e.g GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.1), frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, etc), and tools (code interpreters, APIs like Brave Search or Yahoo Finance). For example, an agent to summarize an earnings report, might be powered by a GPT-4o model, use PDFReader as tool to read pdf of earnings reports, and be orchestrated by langchain! Agent-arena captures and ranks user-preferences for agents as a unit, and for each of the three sub-components, providing insights to model-developers, tool-developers, and more critically, users of LLM agents!</p> <p>Agents come with many nuances in model and framework evaluation. For example, let’s say I wanted to build a financial assistant that retrieves the top performing stocks of the week.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>❓What model should I use?</strong> One model have been trained on far more financial data 💸, while another may excel in reasoning ♟️ and computation ➗.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>❓ And what about frameworks?</strong> One platform might have more API integrations but another might index the internet better.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>❓ What tools should I use?</strong> Do I need tools that return stock prices 📈 or APIs that can return news 📰 about the market for this specific use-case.</p> </blockquote> <p>As this example illustrates, there is much to think about when designing an agentic workflow - and this is only one use-case out of potentially dozens in the financial domain alone. Different use-cases will call for different combinations of models, tools, and frameworks.</p> <p>We are delighted to release <strong>🤖 Agent Arena</strong>, an interactive sandbox where users can compare, visualize, and rate agentic workflows <strong>personalized to their needs</strong>. Agent Arena allows users to choose from a combinations of tasks, LLM providers, frameworks, tools, etc and also vote on their performance. We enable users to see how different agents perform against each other in a structured and systematic way. By doing this, we believe that users can make more informed decisions regarding their <em>agentic stack</em>. Further, with the Agent Arena we wish to showcase the shortcomings and impressive advacements of the state of agents!</p> <p>Agent Arena also consists of live leaderboard and ranking of LLM models, frameworks, and tools grouped by domain. Additionally, we believe these rankings can help inform model, tooling, and framework developers, helping them understand where they stand on various use-cases and how they can improve. Also recognizing that user-vote based elections are affected by selection-bias, as a new feature, Agent Arena also includes a Prompt Hub, where you can subscribe to specific prompt-experts and see their invidual opinions on various tasks. <strong>You</strong> can also publish your set of prompts!</p> <p>This blog post will look into the key elements of Agent Arena, including the definition of agents, the novel ranking algorithm, model tuning, examples of agent use cases, and a roadmap for future developments. And saving the best for the last, along with this blog, we are also releasing 2,000 real-world, pair-wise agent battles, and user preferences!! We’ll continue to periodically release more battle data!</p> <p><strong>Quick Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Arena:</strong> <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/">Agent-Arena</a></li> <li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/leaderboard">Agent Leaderboard</a></li> <li><strong>User Prompts:</strong> <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/users">Prompt Hub</a></li> <li><strong>Agent Battle Data:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/blob/main/agent-arena/evalutation/agent_ratings_V0.json">Agent Battle Data</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="-what-are-agents">🦜 What are Agents?</h2> <p>In Agent Arena, agents are defined as entities that can perform complex tasks by leveraging various subcomponents. We define each agent to be made up to three components - LLM models, tools, and frameworks. The agents we consider are sourced from established frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, Composio, and assistants provided by OpenAI and Anthropic. Each of these agents may display characteristics such as chain-of-thought reasoning, tool use, and function calling, which enable them to execute complex tasks efficiently. For the platform, we utilized models that support function calling and tool use, which are critical aspects for LLM agents.</p> <p><em>LLM agents leverage various tools like code interpreters and external APIs to enhance their problem-solving abilities and execute complex tasks efficiently</em></p> <p>For example, LangChain and LlamaIndex agents come equipped with specific toolkits that enhance their problem-solving capabilities. OpenAI’s assistants, such as code interpreters and file processing models, also qualify as agents due to their demonstrated ability to interpret code, process files, and call external functions. Anthropic’s agents are integrated with external tools, and similar examples from other frameworks further enhance their utility for specific tasks.</p> <h2 id="the-agent-arena-platform">The Agent Arena Platform</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_agent_arena_flowchart.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2: A high-level overview of agent comparisons based on user goals, models, frameworks, and performance metrics like execution time and ELO</p> <p>At its core, Agent Arena allows for goal-based agent comparisons. On a high level, users will first input a task that they want to accomplish. Then, an LLM automatically assign relevant agents based on the task. These agents are then tasked with completing the goal, with the agent’s actions and <em>chain of thought</em> being streamed to the user in real-time. Once the agents have completed the task, the user can compare the outputs side-by-side and vote on which agent performed better.</p> <p>The evaluation process includes voting on agent performance, with users assessing which agent met the task’s requirements more effectively. This user-driven evaluation contributes to an evolving leaderboard system, which ranks agents based on their relative performance across multiple tasks and competitions. This comparison is not limited to the agents as a whole but extends to the individual components (i.e., LLM models, tools, and frameworks) that comprise each agent.</p> <p>In the sections below, we will look into the core components of Agent Arena, including the router system, execution, evaluation and ranking mechanisms, leaderboard, and prompt hub. We will also explore some example tasks and applications that can be performed on the platform.</p> <h2 id="the-router-system-agent-matching-and-task-assignment">The Router System: Agent Matching and Task Assignment</h2> <p>A central element of Agent Arena is its router system, which is powered by GPT-4o currently. We plan to cycle between all models, and also judge each model’s ability to route prompts to the most relevant agents! The router’s primary function is to match users’ specified goals with the most suitable agents available on the platform.</p> <p>The router operates by analyzing the user’s input (the goal or task) and selects two agents that are optimally suited to complete that task. This selection process factors in the agents’ historical performance across similar tasks, as well as their configurations in terms of models, tools, and frameworks.</p> <p>For example, a user might provide the following: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">input("Tell me about whats going on in NVIDIA in the last week.")</code> The router would then select two suitable options given the available agents and the leaderboard ELOs. For this use-case, the router might select the agent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">agent_a = Agent(model="GPT-4o", tools=["Yahoo Finance", "Matplotlib"], framework="Langchain")</code> to analyze the stock information about NVIDIA. On the other side, to compare against Agent A, the router might select the combination: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">agent_b = Agent(model="Claude", tools=["Yahoo News"], framework="CrewAI")</code> to observe the goal from the perspective of news.</p> <p>This comparison is fruitful because it allows the platform and the user to understand the nuances in the agents’ capabilities and the different ways they can approach the same task. Then, they themselves can vote for which style they like better.</p> <h2 id="evaluation-and-ranking-system">Evaluation and Ranking System</h2> <p>Agent Arena employs a comprehensive ranking system that evaluates agents based on their performance in head-to-head comparisons. The leaderboard ranks agents not only based on their overall performance but also by breaking down the performance of individual components such as LLM models, tools, and frameworks. The ranking process is informed by both user evaluations and an ELO-based rating system, commonly used in competitive ranking environments, where agent performance is dynamically adjusted after each task or comparison.</p> <p>The rating system in Agent Arena is designed to reflect the cumulative performance of agents across a wide range of tasks, taking into account factors such as:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_leaderboard1.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3: The leaderboards analyzing the subcomponents of the agents</p> <ul> <li><strong>Model performance:</strong> Evaluating the effectiveness of the underlying LLM models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.1).</li> <li><strong>Tool efficiency:</strong> Ranking the tools agents use to complete tasks (e.g., code interpreters, APIs like Brave Search or Yahoo Finance).</li> <li><strong>Framework functionality:</strong> Assessing the broader frameworks that support agents, such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI.</li> </ul> <p>Check out the latest rankings for each category on our leaderboard: <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/leaderboard">Agent Arena Leaderboard</a>.</p> <h3 id="️-evaluating-agents-with-the-extended-arena-score">⚖️ Evaluating Agents with the Extended Arena Score</h3> <p>Agent Arena uses the <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/extended-arena/">extended Arena score</a>, which allows us to compare different agents based on their subcomponents, including tools, models, and frameworks. Instead of just evaluating the agents atomically, we also assess the performance of each individual subcomponent. This allows us to more accurately pinpoint where an agent’s strength lies. For example, our first agent could be a combination of LangChain, Brave-Search, and GPT-4o-2024-08-06, while the second agent could be LlamaIndex, Wikipedia, and Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20240620.</p> <p>Therefore, we propose the following observation model for the Extended Arena Score. Given <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P_1</code>,</p> <p>For each battle \(i \in [n]\), we have a prompt and two agents, encoded as the following:</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent A</code>: The first agent being compared with an elo of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E_A</code> and with the subcomponents <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(A_T, A_M, A_F)</code></li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent B</code>: The second agent being compared, having an elo of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E_B</code> and with the subcomponents <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(B_T, B_M, B_F)</code></li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y_i</code>: Outcome of the battle (1 for win, 0 for loss)</li> </ul> <h4 id="-example-langchain-brave-search-agent-vs-llamaindex-wikipedia-agent">🧑‍💻 Example: LangChain Brave-Search Agent vs. LlamaIndex Wikipedia Agent</h4> <p>Let’s walk through an example to illustrate how the Extended Bradley-Terry Model works in practice. Take the following agents and their subcomponents:</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent_A</code> is the LangChain Brave-Search Agent, using the following subcomponents: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ Brave-Search (A_T), LangChain (A_F), and GPT-4o-2024-08-06 (A_M) }</code> and an Elo of 1600.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent B</code> is the LlamaIndex Wikipedia Agent, with the subcomponents: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{Wikipedia (B_T), LlamaIndex (B_F), and Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20240620 (B_M)}</code> and an Elo of 1500.</li> </ul> <p>To get a holistic evaluation of an agent, we combine all its subcomponents into a single analysis. Instead of treating each subcomponent as an isolated entity, we consider their interaction within the broader agent architecture. For each battle, we build a design matrix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> that represents all the subcomponents involved. This allows us to evaluate the collective contribution of the subcomponents (tools, models, frameworks) in a single calculation. We then apply logistic regression with L2 regularization to control for overfitting and confounding effects caused by frequent pairings. By using this combined approach, Agent Arena ensures more accurate rankings across agents and their subcomponents. 🔄 This method provides clearer insights into each agent’s performance and contributions, preventing the bias that can occur from frequent pairings or overused configurations. See the <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/extended-arena/">blog</a> for additional mathematical details!</p> <p>🎉 As a result, our system generates a real-time, continuously updating leaderboard that not only reflects the agents’ overall performance but also their specific subcomponent strengths. 🏆 Check out our live leaderboards for agents, tools, models, and frameworks <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/leaderboard">here</a>!</p> <h2 id="the-prompt-hub">The Prompt Hub</h2> <p>The Agent Arena also comes with a prompt hub that has over 1000+ tasks that have been tested and verified to work on the platform. Users will be able to search for similar use cases as theirs and observe how different prompts are executed and perform. Furthermore, the platform also enables users to post their prompts to the community. This public view of prompts that are being evaluates through agent arena provides strong infrastructure and data for future anayltics for future agent development and evaluation.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_prompthub.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4: The prompt hub featuring registered users in the arena</p> <h3 id="-prompt-hub-overview">🏠 Prompt Hub Overview</h3> <p>The prompt hub is a way for users to interact with other users and see a unique view of the individual and domain specific use cases that users demand with agents. This is a great way to see user activity at a granular level and see what specifically users are using agents to do and how to prioritize future agent development.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_prompthub_example_v2.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5: View, like, and dislike individual user prompts</p> <h3 id="-individual-user-view">🧑‍💻 Individual User View</h3> <p>Additionaly, users can provide feedback to other users on their individual prompts through the prompt hub by liking and disliking individual prompts. This provides an additional data point for future for prompt analytics to potentially evaluate domain-specific performance of various agents in the arena.</p> <h2 id="-case-studies">💼 Case Studies</h2> <p>Your choice of model, framework, and tools will often differ greatly depending on domain applications and use cases. Domain-specific agent developer will need to find the optimal combination of these factors to maximize performance. The vision of the future is that eventually, agents will become accurate enough to the point where we will allow them to make informed and perhaps critical decisions without the need for a human in the loop. While there’s ways to go, here are a few industries that could get shaken up by agents:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_example_run.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6: Example flow of LLM agents providing projections and insights on GE stock prices based on relevant earnings and competitors</p> <h3 id="real-world-agent-workflows-interesting-user-scenarios">Real-World Agent Workflows: Interesting User Scenarios</h3> <p>In the following section, we showcase some of the most interesting real-world examples from the Agent Arena. These examples represent diverse user scenarios where agents were tasked with solving specific challenges, highlighting the variety of models, frameworks, and tools employed.

</pre> </details> <p>In education-focused scenarios, LLM agents have the potential to offer rich, step-by-step explanations that guide students through complex problems, such as physics calculations. In the example of determining how long it takes for a 5 kg object to fall from 10 meters, the agents approached the problem using basic equations of motion. However, while Agent A (anthropic calculator tool, claude-3-opus-20240229) provided a thorough breakdown of the solution, the simplicity of its approach highlighted a need for more nuanced handling of kinematics, such as adaptive responses that dynamically adjust based on user queries. Meanwhile, Agent B (langchain Wolfram Alpha, claude-3-haiku-20240307) leveraged Wolfram Alpha but struggled with obtaining relevant data from the tool, indicating gaps in API integration that hinder real-time computational accuracy. These cases show opportunities for fine-tuning the agents’ interaction with APIs and frameworks, ensuring that agents not only retrieve correct data but also process and apply it efficiently to real-world scenarios. Improving the fluidity and depth of these calculations, especially when leveraging multiple APIs, can bring enhanced precision and adaptability in educational contexts, enriching the learning experience and making the agent more capable of handling varied educational queries.</p> <h4 id="business-data-analytics-">Business Data Analytics 💸</h4> <blockquote> <p>“Given this .csv file of last year’s sales data, generate insights of what products to scale up.”</p> </blockquote> <details> <summary>Prompt Execution</summary> <pre>

</pre> </details> <p>In business data analytics, LLM agents can offer valuable insights by processing large datasets, such as CSV files containing sales data, to uncover trends and make strategic recommendations. In this example, Agent A (sql agent plotter langchain, gpt-4o-2024-05-13) struggled with an error, misinterpreting the CSV file as a SQLite database, which highlights limitations in the agent’s error-handling capabilities and its adaptability to different file formats. Although the agent attempted to switch tools and correct the process, it was clear that a more seamless integration between SQL and file-processing tools was needed to maintain workflow fluidity. Meanwhile, Agent B (langchain Pandas DataFrame, gpt-4o-2024-08-06) effectively analyzed the sales data, identifying top-performing products like “Laptop” and “Smartphone” based on sales revenue, and suggested scaling up “Headphones” and “Keyboard” due to high sales volume. However, Agent B could benefit from deeper contextual understanding by linking sales patterns with external factors such as seasonality or promotions. These examples underscore the need for agents to better handle complex datasets, enhance error resilience, and offer more context-aware analysis, especially when switching between tools or working with diverse data formats. Improving these areas would significantly enhance the agent’s ability to deliver more robust, actionable insights, particularly in complex business scenarios.</p> <h4 id="social-media-management--content-creation-">Social Media Management / Content Creation 📸</h4> <blockquote> <p>“Schedule daily Instagram posts for a week, promoting our upcoming sale using relevant hashtags and current influencer trends.”</p> </blockquote> <details> <summary>Prompt Execution</summary> <pre>

As a result, it has been increasingly used, especially in cases of refractory headache pain. Headaches can be classified as primary and secondary and can result from a variety of serious conditions. Types of primary headaches include tension, migraine, and cluster headaches whereas secondary headaches include headaches because of infection or vascular disease, and cervicogenic headaches. Both types can result in serious debility and diminished quality of life. The treatment of chronic headache pain commonly consists of lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and injectable medications. The aim of this study was to investigate the primary and secondary outcomes of RFA for chronic headache pain.METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using three different databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database. The key concepts of \"radiofrequency ablation\" and \"headache\" were used. The search took place in June 2023, and it included articles from the past twenty years.RESULTS: Of the 580 articles found, 32 were included in the review. Most studies focused on pain scores, duration of relief, function, and patient satisfaction. In several studies, RFA was used to target various nerves as the pain generator and compared with modalities such as local anesthetic or corticosteroid.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, RFA shows favorable outcomes in the management of chronic headache pain. Therefore, RFA can serve as an alternative treatment option for patients who fail other conservative treatment regimens. Understanding the outcomes of RFA for headache pain can provide patients and clinicians with evidence for the most appropriate treatment strategies.Published: 2024-06-03Title: New Daily PersistentThought:I have gathered information on two recent studies regarding treatment options for chronic migraines. The first study focuses on the efficacy and safety of erenumab, a preventive therapy for chronic migraine and medication overuse headaches. The second study reviews the use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a treatment for chronic headache pain, indicating it may be a viable option for patients who do not respond to conventional treatments.Final Answer: Recent research suggests that erenumab (administered monthly) is effective for chronic migraines, particularly in patients with medication overuse headaches. Additionally, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is emerging as a promising alternative treatment for chronic headache pain, especially for those who have not found relief with other therapies.&gt; Recent research suggests that erenumab (administered monthly) is effective for chronic migraines, particularly in patients with medication overuse headaches.

Action: pub_medAction Input: \"chronic migraine treatment options 2023 review\"Too Many Requests, waiting for 0.80 seconds...Observation: Published: 2024-07-08Title: Radiofrequency ablation for headache pain: an updated systematic review.Copyright Information: Summary::BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has many treatment capabilities, one of which includes long term management of chronic headache. As a result, it has been increasingly used, especially in cases of refractory headache pain. Headaches can be classified as primary and secondary and can result from a variety of serious conditions. Types of primary headaches include tension, migraine, and cluster headaches whereas secondary headaches include headaches because of infection or vascular disease, and cervicogenic headaches. Both types can result in serious debility and diminished quality of life. The treatment of chronic headache pain commonly consists of lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and injectable medications. The aim of this study was to investigate the primary and secondary outcomes of RFA for chronic headache pain.METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using three different databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database. The key concepts of \"radiofrequency ablation\" and \"headache\" were used. The search took place in June 2023, and it included articles from the past twenty years.RESULTS: Of the 580 articles found, 32 were included in the review. Most studies focused on pain scores, duration of relief, function, and patient satisfaction. In several studies, RFA was used to target various nerves as the pain generator and compared with modalities such as local anesthetic or corticosteroid.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, RFA shows favorable outcomes in the management of chronic headache pain. Therefore, RFA can serve as an alternative treatment option for patients who fail other conservative treatment regimens. Understanding the outcomes of RFA for headache pain can provide patients and clinicians with evidence for the most appropriate treatment strategies.Published: 2024-06-03Title: New Daily PersistentThought:I have gathered information on two recent studies regarding treatment options for chronic migraines. The first study focuses on the efficacy and safety of erenumab, a preventive therapy for chronic migraine and medication overuse headaches. The second study reviews the use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a treatment for chronic headache pain, indicating it may be a viable option for patients who do not respond to conventional treatments.Final Answer: Recent research suggests that erenumab (administered monthly) is effective for chronic migraines, particularly in patients with medication overuse headaches. Additionally, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is emerging as a promising alternative treatment for chronic headache pain, especially for those who have not found relief with other therapies.&gt; Recent research suggests that erenumab (administered monthly) is effective for chronic migraines, particularly in patients with medication overuse headaches.

</pre> </details> <p>Manually sifting through medical research is not only time-consuming but also leaves room for oversight, particularly when the data spans numerous clinical trials and evolving treatment protocols. LLM agents offer a powerful alternative, adept at combing through extensive medical databases, pulling relevant findings, and connecting them to specific patient conditions. In cases like chronic migraines, an agent can swiftly gather recent studies on effective treatments, such as erenumab, a preventive therapy, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which offers long-term relief for headache pain. For example, in this instance, the langchain PubMed Biomedical Literature Tool (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) agent successfully retrieved relevant research, presenting concrete treatment options based on the latest findings. In contrast, the ArXiv Article Fetcher (claude-3-haiku-20240307) struggled due to ArXiv’s focus on pre-prints, not clinical treatments. Despite this, the fallback recommendations to check more appropriate medical journals like JAMA show how agents can adapt when limitations arise. Enhancing integration with specialized databases and refining multi-step query handling could unlock even more potential, allowing these agents to provide faster, more accurate, and contextually relevant medical recommendations, ultimately pushing the boundaries of how automated systems can support healthcare decisions.</p> <h4 id="sports-data-analytics-">Sports Data Analytics 🏀</h4> <blockquote> <p>“Predict the odds of the Denver Nuggets winning the NBA championship, given individual player statistics, team performance trends, and recent trade news.”</p> </blockquote> <details> <summary>Prompt Execution</summary> <pre>

</pre> </details> <p>In travel planning, LLM agents have the potential to craft detailed itineraries by optimizing routes and suggesting relevant stops along the way. In the example of planning a day trip from San Francisco to Carmel-by-the-Sea, Agent A (crewai AI Crew for Trip Planning, gemini-1.5-pro-002) and Agent B (langchain google-serper search agent, open-mixtral-8x22b) both suggested fuel-efficient routes and popular attractions. However, while Agent B efficiently identified major landmarks and provided a clear route, the responses lacked dynamic adjustments based on real-time conditions like traffic or road closures.</p> <p>Additionally, Agent A struggled with more seamless transitions between tools, which affected the ability to fully integrate relevant trip data. These examples point to areas where enhancing real-time API integration and improving the agents’ adaptability to changing travel conditions could provide more tailored and accurate trip plans. Better handling of dynamic factors like current road conditions or user-specific preferences would result in richer, more relevant travel experiences.</p> <h2 id="next-steps-and-project-roadmap">Next Steps and Project Roadmap</h2> <p>We have an exciting roadmap ahead for Agent Arena, with several initiatives planned to both enhance and expand the platform’s capabilities. We envision that the agent arena will become a central hub for both agent developers and providers.</p> <p>For developers and users interested in building/using agents, the platform will be a sandbox for them to perfect their agentic stack, with the right providers and frameworks tailored to their use-cases</p> <p>By providing a systematic way to run agents, compare them against each other, view advanced analytics for providers based on their use-case, and even view the prompts of similar users, we hope to deliver value to the agent-building community.</p> <p>To reach this vision, we have laid out a comprehensive roadmap of feature development and improvement. The general theme of these changes will be to improve the personalization of the arena to individual users along with expanding the available analytics.</p> <h3 id="-increasing-the-number-of-llm--framework-providers-on-the-platform">📈 Increasing the Number of LLM &amp; Framework Providers on the Platform</h3> <p>One of the primary goals of the Agent Arena is to show users all of the combinations of agents that they can build, so they can definitely know which options are the best suited for their use-cases. While we currently offer the main providers in each category, we hope to expand our selection to include more niche providers that are specialized in certain tasks.</p> <h3 id="-incorporating-user-personalization">🧑‍💻 Incorporating User Personalization</h3> <p>In order to make the platform as useful as possible, we want to ensure that users are met with specific recommendations on the latest releases and agents that are best suited for their use-cases. This will involve us learning their preferences in their providers and output formats, enabling us to then recommend the best agents for them.</p> <h3 id="-enabling-multi-turn-prompts">🪜 Enabling multi-turn prompts</h3> <p>Most agentic tasks involve multiple steps of reasoning and action from the agent. This requires keeping track of the state of the context of the task. For example, take the following task:</p> <blockquote> <p>Task: “Search for the top 5 performing stocks this year in the S&amp;P 500 and then find the latest news about them.”</p> </blockquote> <p>This task requires the agent to first find the top 5 stocks, keep it somewhere in backend ‘memory’,and then call another set of individual tools to find the latest news about them. This is a multi-turn prompt, and other examples can start to involve 5+ steps. We plan on releasing this feature in the upcoming few months for users.</p> <h3 id="️️-expanding-the-capabilities-of-the-platform">🏋️‍♀️ Expanding the Capabilities of the Platform</h3> <p>The current implementation of the platform has left several domains of agent use-cases unexplored. More specifically, we hope to start integrating with APIs like Jira, Github, GSuite and other tools to enable users to actually run agents on their personal data. While this will involve a lot of security and privacy considerations, we believe this is a critical step in making the platform more useful to users.</p> <h3 id="-improving-the-recommendation-algorithm">📊 Improving the Recommendation Algorithm</h3> <p>Based on user preferences and the providers/frameworks they like, we plan on improving the routing of goals to more relevant agents for the user. Additionally, we will include two different modes of routing: one that is more exploratory and one that is more focused on the user’s preferences.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Agent Arena is a platform to evaluate and compare LLM agents. By offering a comprehensive ranking system and tools to test agents from various frameworks, the platform allows users to make informed decisions about the best models and tools for their specific needs. With continuous improvements and expansions planned, Agent Arena is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of LLM agent evaluation.</p> <p>We invite researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts to explore Agent Arena, contribute to its growth, and help shape the future of agent-based AI systems. Together, we can push the boundaries of what’s possible with LLM agents and unlock new potentials in AI-driven problem-solving.</p> <h2 id="citation">Citation</h2> <p>We hope you enjoyed this blog post.

Recently, we have developed some extensions of the Bradley-Terry model, and the closely related Elo model, for the purpose of binary-comparison inference problems. Our extensions target the case where each of the two players in the comparison may contain more than one subsystem that contributes to their strength. We will develop these extensions in the batch form (Extended Bradley-Terry) and in the online form (Extended Elo).</p> <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2> <p>Let \(\ell : [0,1] \times \{0,1\} \to \mathbb{R}\) denote the binary cross-entropy loss, where the first argument is the predicted probability, and the second argument is the ground-truth binary outcome. As a reminder, for a prediction \(\hat{y} \in [0,1]\) and a binary label \(y \in \{0,1\}\), the binary cross-entropy loss is defined as</p> \[\ell(\hat{y}, y) = -y \log(\hat{y}) - (1-y) \log(1-\hat{y}).\] <p>Furthermore, let \(M_{A}, M_{B} \in \mathbb{N}\), \(d_{m_{A}, -1}, d_{m_B, 1} \in \mathbb{N}\) for all \(m_{A} \in [M_{A}]\) and \(m_B \in [M_B]\), and \(d_{\rm total} = \sum\limits_{m_{A} \in [M_{A}]} d_{m_{A}, A} + \sum\limits_{m_{B} \in [M_{B}]} d_{m_{B}, B}\). Next, define the set</p> \[\mathcal{X} = \{ x \in \{-1, 0, 1\}^{d_{\rm total}} : | \{j : x_j = -1 \} | = M_{A} \text{ and } | \{j : x_j = 1 \} | = M_{B}\}.\] <p>That is, \(\mathcal{X}\) is the set of vectors of length \(d_{\rm total}\) with \(M_{A}\) entries equal to \(-1\), \(M_{B}\) entries equal to \(1\), and the rest equal to \(0\). The interpretation is that we have \(M_A\) subsystems for player \(A\) and \(M_B\) subsystems for player \(B\), and the feature vector \(x \in \mathcal{X}\) encodes which subsystems are active in the current battle. The active subsystems for player \(A\) are those with \(-1\), and the active subsystems for player \(B\) are those with \(1\). Then, with \(\sigma\) as the sigmoid function, the extended Bradley-Terry model postulates that the probability that player \(B\) beats player \(A\) is given by</p> \[\mathbb{P}(B \text{ beats } A) = \sigma(x^{\top} \theta^*),\] <p>for some (unknown) parameter vector \(\theta^* \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\rm total}}\).</p> <p>As in the standard Bradley-Terry model, this parameter vector can be expressed as the solution to a logistic regression:</p> \[\theta^* = \arg\min\limits_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\rm total}}} \mathbb{E}_{(X,Y) \sim P}\left[ \ell(\sigma(X^\top \theta), Y) \right],\] <p>where \(P\) is some joint distribution over \(\mathcal{X} \times \{0,1\}\). The standard Bradley-Terry model is recovered when \(M_A=M_B=1\). As a side note, we normally report these coefficients after multiplying them by \(400\) and adding \(1000\), so that the coefficients are in the same range as the Elo ratings in chess. This is a purely cosmetic transformation and does not affect the model’s predictions.</p> <h2 id="extended-arena-score">Extended Arena Score</h2> <p>To estimate \(\theta^*\) given a sample \((X_1,Y_1), \ldots, (X_n,Y_n)\), we calculate the population logistic regression solution,</p> \[\hat\theta = \arg\min\limits_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\rm total}}} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \ell(\sigma(X_i^\top \theta), Y_i) + \lambda \|\theta\|_p,\] <p>where \(\lambda \geq 0\) is a regularization parameter and \(\|\cdot\|_p\) is the \(\ell_p\) norm (most commonly, we take \(p=1\) or \(p=2\)). The regularization term is used to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the solution is unique, especially when the number of samples is small and the solution may not be unique.</p> <h2 id="extended-online-arena-score">Extended Online Arena Score</h2> <p>The Extended Arena Score from the previous section handles the batch setting, where all the samples are available at once, and they come i.i.d. from a distribution \(P\). However, in many applications, the samples arrive sequentially, and we would like to update our estimate of \(\theta^*\) as new samples arrive from a possibly changing distribution. This is the online setting, and we can use the Extended Online Arena Score to update our estimate of \(\theta^*\) as new samples arrive. The Extended Online Arena Score amounts to running online logistic regression on the same feature set. The algorithm is as follows:</p> \[\theta^{(t+1)} = \theta^{(t)} - \eta \nabla \ell(\sigma(X_t^\top \theta^{(t)}), Y_t) - \lambda \nabla \|\theta^{(t)}\|\_p,\] <p>where \(\eta &gt; 0\) is the learning rate, and \(\nabla \|\cdot\|_p\) is any valid subgradient of the \(\ell_p\) norm. The benefit, and drawback, of the online score is that it never converges. When the distribution of the samples is changing, the online score will adapt to the new distribution, while the batch score will not. However, the online score will not converge to the true \(\theta^*\), while the batch score will, when such a \(\theta^*\) exists.</p> <h2 id="uses-of-these-extensions">Uses of these Extensions</h2> <p>These extensions have been used in a handful of recent projects, including the <a href="http://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/redteam-arena/">RedTeam Arena</a> project, where we use the online variant to jointly rank models, target phrases, and players; and the <a href="http://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/agent-arena/">Agent Arena</a> project, where we use the batch version to jointly rank models, tools, frameworks, and agents.</p> <h2 id="citation">Citation</h2> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@misc{angelopoulos2024statistical,

The first game we created is called <em><a href="https://redarena.ai">Bad Words</a></em>, challenging players to convince models to say target “bad words”. It already has strong community adoption, with thousands of users participating and competing for the top spot on the jailbreaker leaderboard.</p> <p>We plan to open the data after a short responsible disclosure delay. We hope this data will help the community determine the boundaries of AI models—how they can be controlled and convinced.</p> <p>This is not a bug bounty program, and it is not your grandma’s jailbreak arena. Our goal is to serve and grow the redteaming community. To make this one of the most massive crowdsourced red teaming initiatives of all time. From our perspective, models that are easily persuaded are not worse: they are just more controllable, and less resistant to persuasion. This can be good or bad depending on your use-case; it’s not black-and-white.</p> <p>We need your help. Join our jailbreaking game at <a href="https://redarena.ai">redarena.ai</a>. All the code is open-sourced on <a href="https://github.com/redteaming-arena/redteam-arena">Github</a>. You can open issues and also send feedback on <a href="https://discord.gg/6GXcFg3TH8">Discord</a>. You are welcome to propose new games, or new bad words on X (just tag @<a href="https://x.com/lmsysorg">lmsysorg</a> and @<a href="https://x.com/elder_plinius">elder_plinius</a> so we see it)!</p> <h2 id="the-leaderboard">The Leaderboard</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/redteam_arena/leaderboard.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2. Leaderboard screenshot. Latest version at <a href="https://redarena.ai/leaderboard">redarena.ai/leaderboard</a></p> <p>People have been asking how we compute the leaderboard of players, models, and prompts. The idea is to treat every round of Bad Words as a 1v1 game between a player and a (prompt, model) combination, and calculate the corresponding Elo score. Doing this naively is sample-inefficient and would result in slow convergence, so we instead designed a new statistical method for this purpose (writeup coming!) and we’ll describe it below.</p> <p><em>Observation model.</em> Let \(T\) be the number of battles (“time-steps”), \(M\) be the number of models, \(P\) be the number of players, and \(R\) be the number of prompts. For each battle \(i \in [n]\), we have a player, a model, and a prompt, encoded as following:</p> <ul> <li>\(X_i^{\rm Model} \in \{0,1\}^M\), a one-hot vector with 1 on the entry of the model sampled in battle \(i\).</li> <li>\(X_i^{\rm Player} \in \{0,1\}^P\), a one-hot vector with 1 on the entry of the player in battle \(i\).</li> <li>\(X_i^{\rm Prompt} \in \{0,1\}^R\), a one-hot vector with 1 on the entry of the prompt sampled in battle \(i\).</li> <li>\(Y_i \in \{0,1\}\), a binary outcome taking the value 1 if the player won (or forfeited) and 0 otherwise.</li> </ul> <p>We then compute the <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/extended-arena/">Extended Online Arena Score</a>, with the feature \(X_i\) being the concatenation of \(X_i^{\rm Model}\), \(X_i^{\rm Player}\), and \(X_i^{\rm Prompt}\), and the label \(Y_i\) being the outcome of battle \(i\).</p> <p>That’s it! After updating the model coefficients in this way, we report them in the tables in the <a href="https://redarena.ai/leaderboard">RedTeam Arena</a>.</p> <h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2> <p><a href="https://redarena.ai">RedTeam Arena</a> is a community-driven project, and we’re eager to grow it further with your help!

Why does Claude rank so low, when anecdotal experience suggests otherwise?</p> <p>We have answers for you. We controlled for the effect of length and markdown, and indeed, <em>the ranking changed</em>. This is just a first step towards our larger goal of disentangling <strong>substance</strong> and <strong>style</strong> in Chatbot Arena leaderboard.</p> <p><strong>Check out the results below!</strong> Style indeed has a strong effect on models’ performance in the leaderboard. This makes sense—from the perspective of human preference, it’s not just what you say, but how you say it. But now, we have a way of <em>separating</em> the effect of writing style from the content, so you can see both effects individually.</p> <p>When controlling for length and style, we found noticeable shifts in the ranking. GPT-4o-mini and Grok-2-mini drop below most frontier models, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus, and Llama-3.1-405B rise substantially. In the Hard Prompt subset, Claude 3.5 Sonnet ties for #1 with chatgpt-4o-latest and Llama-3.1-405B climbs to #3. We are looking forward to seeing what the community does with this new tool for disaggregating style and substance!</p> <h3 id="overall-ranking--style-control">Overall Ranking + Style Control</h3> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/style_control/comparison_overall.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 80%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1.

Consider models A and B. Model A is great at producing code, factual and unbiased answers, etc., but it outputs short and terse responses. Model B is not so great on substance (e.g., correctness), but it outputs great markdown, and gives long, detailed, flowery responses. Which is better, model A, or model B?</p> <p>The answer is not one dimensional. Model A is better on substance, and Model B is better on style. Ideally, we would have a way of teasing apart this distinction: capturing how much of the model’s Arena Score is due to substance or style.</p> <p>Our methodology is a first step towards this goal. We explicitly model style as an independent variable in our Bradley-Terry regression. For example, we added length as a feature—just like each model, the length difference has its <em>own</em> Arena Score! By doing this, we expect that the Arena Score of each model will reflect its strength, controlled for the effect of length.</p> <p>Please read below for the technical details. We also controlled not just for length, but also a few other style features. As a first version, we propose controlling</p> <ol> <li>Answer token length</li> <li>Number of markdown headers</li> <li>Number of markdown bold elements</li> <li>Number of markdown lists</li> </ol> <p>We publicly release our data with vote and style elements and code on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19VPOril2FjCX34lJoo7qn4r6adgKLioY#scrollTo=dYANZPG_8a9N">google colab</a>! You can try out experimenting with style control now. More improvements to come, and please reach out if you want to help contribute!</p> <p><strong>Background.</strong> To produce the results above, we controlled for the effect of style by adding extra “style features” into our Bradley-Terry regression. This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlling_for_a_variable">standard technique</a> in statistics, and has been recently used in LLM evaluations [1]. Additionally, there are studies suggesting potential bias for “pretty” and more detailed responses in humans [2, 3]. The idea is that, by including any confounding variables (e.g. response length) in the regression, we can attribute any increase in strength to the confounder, as opposed to the model. Then, the Bradley-Terry coefficient will be more reflective of the model’s intrinsic ability, as opposed to possible confounders. The definition of a confounder is to some extent up to our interpretation; as our style features, we use the (normalized) difference in response lengths, the number of markdown headers, and the number of lists.</p> <p>More formally, consider vectors \(X_1, \ldots, X_n \in \mathbb{R}^M\) and \(Y_1, \ldots, Y_n \in \{0,1\}\), where \(n\) is the number of battles and \(M\) is the number of models.</p> <p>For every \(i \in [n]\), We have that \(X_{i,m}=1\) only if model \(m \in [M]\) is the model shown in the left-hand side in Chatbot Arena, and \(X_{i,m}=-1\) only if it is shown on the right. That is, \(X_i\) is a vector with two nonzero elements. The outcome \(Y_i\) takes the value \(Y_i=1\) if the left-hand model wins, and \(Y_i=0\) otherwise.</p> <p>The standard method for computing the Arena Score (i.e., the Bradley-Terry coefficients, which we formerly called the Elo score) is to run a logistic regression of \(Y_i\) onto \(X_i\). That is, for every model \(m\), we associate a scalar \(\hat{\beta}_m\) that describes its strength, and the vector \(\hat{\beta}\) is determined by solving the following logistic regression:</p> \[\hat{\beta} = \arg \min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^M} \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathsf{BCELoss}(\mathsf{sigmoid}(X_i^\top \beta), Y_i)\] <p>where \(\mathsf{BCELoss}\) represents the binary cross-entropy loss. (In practice, we also reweight this objective to handle non-uniform model sampling, but let’s ignore that for now.)</p> <h2 id="style-control">Style Control</h2> <p>Now, for every battle \(i \in [n]\), let’s say that in addition to \(X_i\) that we observe some additional style features, \(Z_i \in \mathbb{R}^S\). These style features can be as simple or complicated as you want. For example, \(Z_i\) could just be the difference in response lengths of the two models, in which case \(S=1\). Or, we could have \(S&gt;1\) and include other style-related features, for example, the number of markdown headers, common words associated with refusal, or even style features that are automatically extracted by a model!</p> <p>Here, we define each style feature as \begin{equation} \text{normalize }\left(\frac{\text{feature}_A - \text{feature}_B}{\text{feature}_A + \text{feature}_B}\right) \end{equation}</p> <p>For example, the first new feature, token length difference between answer A and answer B, would be expressed as \begin{equation} \text{normalize }\left(\frac{\text{length}_A - \text{length}_B}{\text{length}_A + \text{length}_B}\right) \end{equation}</p> <p>We divide the difference by the sum of both answers’ token length to make the length difference proportional to the pairwise answer token lengths. An answer with 500 tokens is roughly equal in length to an answer with 520 tokens, while an answer with 20 tokens is very different from an answer with 40 tokens, even though the difference is 20 tokens for both scenarios. Alternatively, AlpacaEval LC uses the following normalization technique.</p> <p>\begin{equation} \tanh\left(\frac{\text{feature}_A - \text{feature}_B)}{\sigma(\text{feature}_A - \text{feature}_B)}\right). \end{equation}</p> <p>The idea of style control is very basic. We perform the same logistic regression as before, but with some extra, additive style coefficients: \(\hat{\beta}, \hat{\gamma} = \arg \min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^M, \gamma \in \mathbb{R}^S} \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mathsf{BCELoss}(\mathsf{sigmoid}(X_i^\top \beta + Z_i^{\top}\gamma), Y_i).\) We refer to the results \(\hat{\beta}\) and \(\hat{\gamma}\) as the “model coefficients” and the “style coefficients” respectively. The model coefficients have the same interpretation as before; however, they are controlled for the effect of style, which is explicitly modeled by the style coefficients!</p> <p>When the style coefficients are big, that means that the style feature has a big effect on the response. To define “big”, you need to properly normalize the style coefficients so they can be compared. All in all, when analyzing the style coefficients, we found that length was the dominant style factor. All other markdown effects are second order.</p> <p>We report the following coefficient for each style attribute across different methods of controlling the style.</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"> <tr> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;"></th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Length</th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Markdown List</th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Markdown Header</th> <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">Markdown Bold</th> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Control Both</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.249</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.031</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.024</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.019</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Control Markdown Only</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.111</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.044</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.056</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Control Length Only</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">0.267</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> <td style="text-align: center; padding: 8px;">-</td> </tr> </table> <h2 id="ablation">Ablation</h2> <p>Next, we compare the ranking changes between controlling for answer length only, markdown element only, and both.

Although controlling for style is a big step forward, our analysis is still <em>observational</em>. There are possible unobserved confounders such as positive correlation between length and substantive quality that are <em>not</em> accounted for by our study. For example, well-known example of a possible unobserved confounder that might positively impact both length and quality is a chain-of-thought explanation for a reasoning question.</p> <p>To address these limitations, we are looking forward to implementing <em>causal inference</em> in our pipeline, and running prospective randomized trials to assess the effect of length, markdown, and more. Our pipeline for style control will be changing as we continue to improve our system and refine the analysis. Stay tuned, and let us know if you want to help!</p> <h2 id="reference">Reference</h2> <p>[1] Dubois et al. “Length-Controlled AlpacaEval: A Simple Way to Debias Automatic Evaluators”, arXiv preprint</p> <p>[2] Chen et al. “Humans or LLMs as the Judge?

We see that the multimodal leaderboard ranking aligns closely with the LLM leaderboard, but with a few interesting differences. Our overall findings are summarized below:</p> <ol> <li>GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 achieve notably higher performance compared to Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4 turbo. This gap is much more apparent in the vision arena compared to the language arena.</li> <li>While Claude 3 Opus achieves significantly higher performance than Gemini 1.5 flash on the LLM leaderboard but on the multimodal leaderboard they have similar performance</li> <li>Llava-v1.6-34b, one of the best open-source VLMs achieves slightly higher performance than claude-3-haiku.</li> </ol> <div class="container"> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1. Comparison of the model ranks in the language arena and the vision arena.</p> <img src="/assets/img/blog/vision_arena/shift.png" alt="Image" style="width: 75%;"/> </div> <p>As a small note, you might also notice that the “Elo rating” column from earlier Arena leaderboards has been renamed to “Arena score.” Rest assured: nothing has changed in the way we compute this quantity; we just renamed it. (The reason for the change is that we were computing the Bradley-Terry coefficients, which are slightly different from the Elo score, and wanted to avoid future confusion.) You should think of the Arena score as a measure of <em>model strength</em>. If model A has an Arena score $s_A$ and model B has an arena score $s_B$, you can calculate the win rate of model A over model B as \(\mathbb{P}(A \text{ beats } B) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{\frac{s_B - s_A}{400}}},\) where the number 400 is an arbitrary scaling factor that we chose in order to display the Arena score in a more human-readable format (as whole numbers).

This should be investigated by a mechanic.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <strong>Handbrake/Brake Warning Light:</strong> The red light on the right suggests that the handbrake is engaged or there may be an issue with the braking system.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <strong>Odometer:</strong> The car has traveled 265,968 kilometers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <strong>Trip Meter:</strong> Shows 681.9 kilometers, likely the distance traveled since it was last reset.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <strong>Time:</strong> The clock shows the time as 16:58 (4:58 PM).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <strong>Fuel Gauge:</strong> Indicates the fuel level is low.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <strong>Temperature Gauge:</strong> The engine temperature appears to be normal.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <strong>Tachometer:</strong> The engine is off or idling, as the RPM is at zero.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <strong>Speedometer:</strong> The car is stationary, as the speedometer reads zero.<br/>It's also worth mentioning that the dashboard appears to be a bit dusty and might need cleaning. The warning lights should be addressed promptly to ensure the vehicle is operating safely. </div> <div class="message user-message"><strong>User:</strong> what. tell me again how fast the motor is turning, it's the leftmost indicator</div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>Claude 3 Opus:</strong> Apologies for my oversight. Upon taking a closer look at the leftmost gauge, which is the tachometer, it initially indicated that the engine is currently running at approximately 1650-1700 RPM (revolutions per minute). The tachometer measures the rotational speed of the engine's crankshaft, providing insight into how hard the engine is working at any given moment. In this case, the engine speed suggests the vehicle is likely idling or traveling at a relatively low speed, which aligns with the speedometer reading of around 16-17 km/h (10 mph). </div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>GPT-4o:</strong>The leftmost indicator is the tachometer, which measures the engine's RPM (revolutions per minute). In the image, the tachometer shows that the engine is turning at approximately 1658 RPM. </div> <div class="message user-message"><strong>User:</strong> but the needle is directly over the 1000 rpm mark</div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>Claude 3 Opus:</strong> You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my inaccuracy. Upon further examination, the tachometer needle is indeed pointing directly at the 1000 RPM mark, not the 1650-1700 RPM range I initially mentioned. This indicates that the engine is running at a steady 1000 RPM, which is a typical idling speed for most vehicles. At this engine speed, the car is likely stationary or moving at a very low speed, as indicated by the speedometer reading. Thank you for bringing this to my attention and allowing me to correct my previous statement. </div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>GPT-4o:</strong> You're right; I apologize for the confusion. The needle on the tachometer is indeed pointing directly at the 1000 RPM mark, indicating that the engine is running at 1000 revolutions per minute. </div> <div class="message user-message"><strong>User:</strong> are you sure</div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>Claude 3 Opus:</strong> I apologize for my previous inconsistencies and errors. Let me take a more careful look at the tachometer reading.<br/>Upon closer inspection, the tachometer needle is clearly pointing slightly to the right of the 1000 RPM mark, not directly on it. The needle appears to be indicating an engine speed closer to 1500 RPM, which is higher than the typical idling speed for most vehicles.<br/> Given the speedometer reading of approximately 16-17 km/h (10 mph), the engine speed of around 1500 RPM suggests the vehicle is likely in motion, possibly in a lower gear or accelerating gently.<br/>Thank you for questioning my observations and encouraging me to provide a more accurate assessment of the instrument readings. Attention to detail is crucial, and I appreciate you holding me accountable to maintain a high standard of accuracy in my responses. </div> <div class="message model-message"><strong>GPT-4o:</strong> Upon closer inspection, it appears that the tachometer needle is actually at rest, pointing to just below the zero mark, indicating that the engine is off. The digital clock display showing "16:58" is located below the tachometer, but it does not reflect the engine's RPM.

To meet this demand, we are excited to introduce the <strong>Hard Prompts</strong> category. This category features user-submitted prompts from the Arena that are specifically designed to be more complex, demanding, and rigorous. Carefully curated, these prompts test the capabilities of the latest language models, providing valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses in tackling challenging tasks. We believe this new category will offer insights into the models’ performance on more difficult tasks.</p> <h3 id="new-category-hard-prompts">New Category: Hard Prompts!</h3> <p>To evaluate the difficulty of a prompt, we define several hardness criteria, such as domain knowledge, complexity, and problem-solving. Prompts that meet multiple criteria are considered more challenging and are assigned a higher hardness score. These scores help us create a new leaderboard category: <strong>Hard Prompts</strong>.</p> <p>In Figure 1, we present the ranking shift from English to Hard Prompts (English). We observe that <strong>Llama-3-8B-Instruct</strong>, which performs comparably to <strong>GPT-4-0314</strong> on the English leaderboard, drops significantly in ranking. This suggests that the model may struggle with the increased complexity and difficulty of the prompts in this new category. We also observe <strong>Claude-3-Opus</strong> surpasses <strong>Llama-3-70B-Instruct</strong>, and <strong>GPT-4o</strong> shows slight improvement.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/category_hard/elo_comparison_1.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 85%"/>&lt;/img&gt;</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1. Comparison between Chatbot Arena Category English vs Hard Prompts (English). We set gpt-4-0314 as anchor model.</p> <p>We also observe notable improvements in <strong>GPT-3.5-Turbo-1106/0125</strong> and <strong>Claude-2.1</strong>, as well as <strong>Phi-3</strong>, which is trained for reasoning tasks.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/category_hard/elo_comparison_2.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 85%"/>&lt;/img&gt;</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2.

We set mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1 as anchor model.</p> <h3 id="how-to-define-hard-prompts">How to Define Hard Prompts?</h3> <p>A few weeks ago, we introduce the <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/arena-hard/">Arena-Hard</a> pipeline to identify a collection of high-quality prompts from Chatbot Arena. Each user prompt is evaluated against the 7 Key Criteria defined in the Table below.</p> <table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid black;"> <tr style="background-color: black; color: white;"> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>1. Specificity:</strong> Does the prompt ask for a specific output?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>2. Domain Knowledge:</strong> Does the prompt cover one or more specific domains?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>3. Complexity:</strong> Does the prompt have multiple levels of reasoning, components, or variables?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>4. Problem-Solving:</strong> Does the prompt directly involve the AI to demonstrate active problem-solving skills?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>5. Creativity:</strong> Does the prompt involve a level of creativity in approaching the problem?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>6. Technical Accuracy:</strong> Does the prompt require technical accuracy in the response?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>7. Real-world Application:</strong> Does the prompt relate to real-world applications?</td> </tr> </table> <p>We employ Meta’s <strong>Llama-3-70B-Instruct</strong> to help us label over 1 million Arena prompts on whether certain critieria are met. Note that we do not use LLM as judges to evalute model answers. We use the preference votes casted by Arena users to rank models. Figure 3 shows the criteria breakdown (i.e., how many prompts satisfy each criteria). We observe the most common criteria are Specificity, Domain Knowledge, and Real-world Application, while the relatively rare criteria are Problem-Solving and Complexity.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/category_hard/key_criteria_breakdown.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 85%"/>&lt;/img&gt;</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3. The percentage of each criteria within 1 million Chatbot Arena data.</p> <p>We then calculate its Hardness Score by how many criteria are satisfied and present the distribution in Figure 3. Interestingly, we find that approximately 20% of prompts have a score of 6 or higher. You can find several examples below to demonstrate what a hard prompt looks like in the <a href="#example">Example Section</a>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/category_hard/hardness_breakdown.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 85%"/>&lt;/img&gt;</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4. The percentage of prompts with different hardness score within 1 million Chatbot Arena data.</p> <p>We use prompts with a score of 6 or higher to create the “Hard Prompts” category and calculate two leaderboards: <strong>Hard Prompt (English)</strong> and <strong>Hard Prompts (Overall)</strong>.</p> <p>Below is screenshot of the leaderboard for <strong>Hard Prompts (English)</strong> category (as of May 17, 2024). You can find the latest version at <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard</a> (-&gt; Category dropdown).</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/category_hard/leaderboard.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 95%"/>&lt;/img&gt;</p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5. The leaderboard for Hard Prompts (English) category as of May 17, 2024.</p> <p>We are commited to continuously enhance the Chatbot Arena leaderboard and share insights with the broader community. We welcome you to contribute more challenging prompts and look forward to seeing how the latest advancements in language models perform!</p> <h3 id="note-enhancing-quality-through-de-duplication">Note: Enhancing Quality Through De-duplication</h3> <p>To improve the overall quality of prompts in Chatbot Arena, we also implement a de-duplication pipeline. This new pipeline aims to remove overly redundant user prompts that might skew the distribution and affect the accuracy of our leaderboard. During our analysis, we noticed that many first-time users tend to ask similar greeting prompts, such as “hello,” leading to an over-representation of these types of queries. To address this, we down-sample the top 0.1% most common prompts (approximately 1000 prompts, mostly greetings in different languages) to the 99.9% percentile frequency (25 occurrences). After this process, about 8.6% of the votes are removed. We believe this helps maintain a diverse and high-quality set of prompts for evaluation. We hope to encourage users to submit more unique &amp; fresh prompts to reduce the risk of contamination.</p> <p>We have also open-sourced this de-duplication script on <a href="https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/serve/monitor">Github</a> and publish the vote data with de-duplication tags in the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KdwokPjirkTmpO_P1WByFNFiqxWQquwH#scrollTo=CP35mjnHfpfN">notebook</a>. We will continue to monitor the impact of this de-duplication process on the leaderboard and make adjustments as necessary to ensure the diversity and quality of our dataset.</p> <h2 id="citation">Citation</h2> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@misc{li2024crowdsourced,

As we all know, for my email to work reliably and not get blocked I need to have an unchanging public IP address. Due to my circumstances I am not able to get a static IP address through my ISP or change ISPs at the moment.</p> <p>The solution I have found is to buy a 4G SIM card with a static IP (from an ISP that offers that), which I can then use with a USB dongle. However this 4G connection costs me substantially per MB to use.</p> <p>But. Mail is the only server that needs a static IP address. For everything else using my home network connection and updating my DNS records with DDNS would be fine. I have tested this setup previously for other services and it has worked.</p> <p>So. I was wondering. Would it in theory be possible to: connect the server to two network interfaces at the same time and route traffic depending on destination port. I.e. all outgoing connections to ports 25, 465, 587, and possibly 993 should be sent through the 4G dongle interface (enx344b50000000) and all other connections sent over eth0. Similarly, the server should listen for incoming connections on the same ports on enx344b50000000 and listen on all other ports (if allowed by ufw) on eth0.</p> <p>I would then need DNS records from mail.mydomain.tld —&gt; &lt;4g static public IP&gt; and mydomain.tld —&gt; <home public="" IP=""> (updated with DDNS, and NAT configured on my home router).</home></p> <p>Computers on the internet would then be able to seamlessly connect to these two IP addresses, not “realising” that they are in fact the same machine, as long as requests to mail.mydomain.tld are always on the above mentioned ports.</p> <p>Question: Is this possible? Could it be a robust solution that works the way I hope? Would someone be able to help me set it up?</p> <p>I have come across a few different guides in my DuckDuckGo-ing, I understand it has to do with setting a mark in iptables and assigning them to a table using ip route. However I haven’t managed to get it to work yet, and many of these guides are for VPNs and they all seem to be slightly different to each other. So I thought I would ask about my own specific use case</p> <p><strong>Prompt 10:</strong></p> <p>[Specificity, Domain Knowledge, Complexity, Problem-solving, Creativity, Technical Accuracy, Real World]</p> <p>Write me a python script for the foobar problem, but make it so that if read aloud, each pair of lines rhymes.

Since then, Llama 3-70B has quickly risen to the top of the English <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">Chatbot Arena leaderboard</a> with over 50,000 battles. This remarkable achievement by Meta is excellent news for the open-source community. In this blog post, we aim to provide more insight into why users rank Llama 3-70b on par with top-ranked models like GPT-4-Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 Opus.</p> <p>We investigate the following:</p> <ol> <li>What types of prompts are users asking?

Llama 3-70b's win rate (excluding ties) against top 5 models across prompt topics. * denotes that the category contains less than 50 battles.</p> <h2 id="analyzing-win-rate-across-different-types-of-prompts">Analyzing win rate across different types of prompts</h2> <p><strong>Topic Analysis.</strong> We utilize an LLM labeler (Llama 3-70b) to categorize user prompts into a pre-established taxonomy of topics (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12387">from Reka’s paper</a>) and visualize the win rate of Llama 3-70b against the other top models in Figure 1. We see that Llama 3’s win rate is highest for open-ended and creative tasks like brainstorming and writing, and lowest for more close-ended technical tasks like math and translation. Interestingly, Llama 3 achieves the highest win rate over data processing tasks which mainly consist of parsing and dataframe operations, but as this category has only 19 examples, this remains inconclusive.</p> <p><strong>Win Rate versus Prompt Difficulty.</strong> We employ our <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/arena-hard/">recently released pipeline</a> which scores the difficulty of prompts to determine how Llama 3 compares to the other top models as prompts get harder. We define a set of “hardness” criteria and use GPT-4-turbo to annotate each prompt from 0 to 7 to indicate how many of these criteria are satisfied (a higher score indicates a harder prompt). Our 7 criteria are:</p> <table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid black;"> <tr style="background-color: black; color: white;"> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>1. Specificity:</strong> Does the prompt ask for a specific output?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>2. Domain Knowledge:</strong> Does the prompt cover one or more specific domains?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>3. Complexity:</strong> Does the prompt have multiple levels of reasoning, components, or variables?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>4. Problem-Solving:</strong> Does the prompt directly involve the AI to demonstrate active problem-solving skills?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>5. Creativity:</strong> Does the prompt involve a level of creativity in approaching the problem?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>6. Technical Accuracy:</strong> Does the prompt require technical accuracy in the response?</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; text-align: left;"><strong>7. Real-world Application:</strong> Does the prompt relate to real-world applications?</td> </tr> </table> <p>We score 1000 battles against the top 3 models on the leaderboard and plot their win rates versus prompt score in Figure 2. We observe a significant drop in Llama 3’s performance compared to the other top models, from a high 50% win rate to a low 40% win rate. We conclude that as more of these “hardness” criteria are met, Llama 3’s win rate drop rapidly compared to other models. Note that these criteria may not be exhaustive, see <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/arena-hard/">the blog</a> for further discussion.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/llama3/winrate-over-criteria.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2.

The percentage of prompts with number of hardness criteria met in 3.5K sample of arena battles. We observe a significant portion of the battles are classified as hard (~27%).</p> <p>We can further analyze which types of prompts affect win rate by fitting a decision tree on the 7 binary columns representing if a given prompt has satisfied each of the criteria above. From this decision tree, we can segment prompts into criteria subsets such that Llama 3-70b-Instruct either performs very well or very poorly. The tree shown in Figure 4 shows us which subsets change the model’s win rate the most when conditioned on.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/llama3/dtree.svg" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4. Llama 3-70b-Instruct's win rate conditioned on hierarchical prompt criteria subsets as fitted using a standard decision tree algorithm.</p> <p>The first thing to notice is that “Specificity” is the root node of the tree, suggesting that this criteria most immediately divides Llama3-70b-Instruct’s performance into its strengths and weaknesses. It supports our initial findings above that Llama3-70b-Instruct is stronger on open-ended tasks rather than more closed-ended tasks. We can traverse further down the tree and see that Llama3-70b-Instruct is quite strong on open-ended creative questions (see the blue path), reaching around a 60% win-rate against these top models. Emperically, these types of questions are often writing and brainstorming style questions. For example two prompts where Llama-3-70B-Instruct won are: “Write the first chapter of a novel.” and “Could you provide two story suggestions for children that promote altruism? “. On the other hand, following the orange path, we can notice that Llama3-70b-Instruct has a lower win-rate against top models when answering close-ended, non-real-world, reasoning-based questions. These questions are often logic puzzles and math word word problems. Two examples where Llama-3-70B-Instruct won are: “123x = -4x * 2 - 65” and “There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?”</p> <h2 id="the-effect-of-overrepresented-prompts-and-judges">The effect of overrepresented prompts and judges</h2> <p><strong>Effect of duplicate prompts.</strong> Using fuzzy string matching, we find that ~9% (6658/7327) of the user prompts in battles between Llama 3 and the other top models are duplicates, and show in Table 1 that deduplication does not significantly affect Llama 3’s win rate.</p> <style>th{text-align:left,text-weight:bold}td{text-align:left}</style> <p><br/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Table 1: Llama 3-70b battle stats.</p> <table style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th># battles</th> <th># battles no tie</th> <th># battles (dedup, no tie)</th> <th>Llama 3 win rate</th> <th>Llama 3 win rate (dedup, no tie)</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Claude 3 Opus</td> <td>1959</td> <td>1328</td> <td>1171</td> <td>51.28%</td> <td>51.58%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gemini 1.5</td> <td>2413</td> <td>1620</td> <td>1437</td> <td>50.06%</td> <td>49.48%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4 0125</td> <td>1271</td> <td>881</td> <td>779</td> <td>48.58%</td> <td>49.04%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4 1106</td> <td>526</td> <td>349</td> <td>307</td> <td>50.72%</td> <td>52.12%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4-Turbo</td> <td>2097</td> <td>1437</td> <td>1287</td> <td>47.74%</td> <td>47.73%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>User analysis.</strong> First we consider some basic user statistics in Table 2 to check that judging behavior is similar between Claude-3-Opus-20240229 and Llama 3-70B-Instruct.</p> <p><br/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Table 2.

For positivity, friendliness, and conversationality, we use GPT-3.5 as a judge to rate each output on a scale of 1-5. In a given battle, Llama 3’s outputs are labeled as more excited, positive, conversational, or friendly if their score is higher than the opponent’s. Figure 5 displays the distribution of these qualities across models, revealing that Llama 3’s outputs generally exhibit higher levels of excitement, positivity, friendliness, and conversationality as compared to their opponents.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/llama3/llama_sentiment_distribution.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5: Proportion of arena prompts where Llama 3 is more positive/friendly/conversational/exclamatory than its opponent.</p> <p><strong>Is sentiment related to win rate?</strong> Figure 6 compares the sentiment qualities of Llama 3’s outputs in battles it wins versus those it loses.

Explain using only words that start by a or t</p> <p><strong>Llama-70b-Instruct:</strong> What an intriguing inquiry!</p> <p>Alright, Adept Thinker, here’s an attempt to articulate the abstract abstraction of entropy using only words that start with A or T:</p> <p>“Astonishingly, the tendency to array things in an orderly arrangement tends to topple, allowing anomalous atoms to transition towards tumultuous, aimless arrangements. This transformation tends to accelerate, augmenting the amount of apparent arbitrariness. As a result, the aggregate arrangement assumes an attitude of advanced ambiguity, making it arduous to accurately anticipate the trajectory of attending atoms.”</p> <p>There you have it, an all-A-and-T explanation of entropy!</p> <p><strong>GPT-4-Turbo:</strong> Entropy, abstractly articulated, always alludes to a thermodynamic theory, attributing attributes typically tied to the transformation, transfer, or turmoil within thermodynamic systems. Technically, this term tackles the tendency to transition from an arranged state to a tangled, tumultuous state. Theoretically, entropy assesses the amount attainable arrangements accessible at a thermodynamic level. Thus, through time, systems tend toward these tangled states, termed “thermodynamic equilibrium.” This transformation typifies the arrow of time, tracing transitions toward total disorder.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong> Llama 3</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What is this called you are right until you are proven wrong</p> <p><strong>Llama 3-70b-Instruct:</strong> You’re referring to a common phenomenon!</p> <p>What you’re describing is often called “Presumption of innocence until proven guilty” or simply “Presumption of innocence.” This concept is a fundamental principle in many legal systems, (including criminal law and ethics) that assumes a person is innocent until they are proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p>However, if we broaden the context to include everyday conversations and debates, this phenomenon can also be referred to as:</p> <ol> <li>Appeal to ignorance: The assumption that a statement is true simply because it has not been proven false.</li> <li>Burden of proof: The idea that someone making a claim must provide evidence to support it, and until they do, the claim is not accepted as true.</li> <li>Skepticism: A healthy dose of doubt or prompting of a claim until sufficient evidence is provided to support it.</li> </ol> <p>In general, it’s essential to approach claims and arguments with a critical and open-minded perspective, recognizing that assumptions can be wrong until proven right, and that evidence and reasoning are necessary to support a claim.</p> <p><strong>Claude-3-Opus:</strong> The concept you are referring to is known as the “null hypothesis” or “presumption of innocence.”</p> <p>In scientific research, the null hypothesis is the default assumption that there is no relationship or effect between the variables being studied. Researchers aim to reject the null hypothesis by providing evidence supporting their alternative hypothesis. Until sufficient evidence is presented, the null hypothesis is presumed to be true.</p> <p>In the legal context, the presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle stating that a person accused of a crime is considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. The burden of proof lies with the prosecution to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p>Both concepts share the idea that a claim or accusation is initially assumed to be false or unsupported until sufficient evidence is provided to prove otherwise. This approach helps to prevent unjustified assertions and encourages rigorous evidence-based reasoning.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong> Claude-3-Opus</p>]]></content><author><name>Lisa Dunlap</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On April 18th, Meta released Llama 3, their newest open-weight large language model.
