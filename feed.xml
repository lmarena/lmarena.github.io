Unlike LM-Arena or SimpleQA, our data focuses on current events and diverse real-world use cases (see <a href="#why-search-arena">Sec. 1</a>).</li> <li>Based on 7k human votes (03/18‚Äì04/13), <strong>Gemini-2.5-Pro-Grounding</strong> and <strong>Perplexity-Sonar-Reasoning-Pro</strong> are at the top, followed by the rest of Perplexity‚Äôs Sonar models, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Grounding, and OpenAI‚Äôs web search API models. Standardizing citation styles had minimal effect on rankings (see <a href="#leaderboard">Sec. 2</a>).</li> <li>Three features show strong positive correlation with human preference: response length, citation count, and citing specific web sources like YouTube and online forum/blogs (see <a href="#analyses">Sec. 3</a>).</li> <li>We open-sourced our dataset (<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmarena-ai/search-arena-v1-7k">ü§ó search-arena-7k</a>) and code (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h7rR7rhePBPuIfaWsVNlW87kv3DLibPS?usp=sharing">‚öôÔ∏è Colab notebook</a>) for leaderboard analysis.

Search Arena leaderboard.</p> <h2 id="why-search-arena">1. Why Search Arena?</h2> <p>Web search is undergoing a major transformation. Search-augmented LLM systems integrate dynamic real-time web data with the reasoning, problem-solving, and question-answering capabilities of LLMs. These systems go beyond traditional retrieval, enabling richer human‚Äìweb interaction. The rise of models like Perplexity‚Äôs Sonar series, OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-Search, and Google‚Äôs Gemini-Grounding highlights the growing impact of search-augmented LLM systems.</p> <p>But how should these systems be evaluated? Static benchmarks like SimpleQA focus on factual accuracy on challenging questions, but that‚Äôs only one piece. These systems are used for diverse tasks‚Äîcoding, research, recommendations‚Äîso evaluations must also consider how they retrieve, process, and present information from the web. Understanding this requires studying how humans use and evaluate these systems in the wild.</p> <p>To this end, we developed search arena, aiming to (1) enable crowd-sourced evaluation of search-augmented LLMs and (2) release a diverse, in-the-wild dataset of user‚Äìsystem interactions.</p> <p>Since our <a href="https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1902036561119899983">initial launch</a> on March 18th, we‚Äôve collected over 11k votes across 10+ models. We then filtered this data to construct 7k battles with user votes (<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmarena-ai/search-arena-v1-7k">ü§ó search-arena-7k</a>) and calculated the leaderboard with this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h7rR7rhePBPuIfaWsVNlW87kv3DLibPS?usp=sharing">‚öôÔ∏è Colab notebook</a>. Below, we provide details on the collected data and the supported models.</p> <h3>A. Data</h3> <p><b>Data Filtering and Citation Style Control.</b> Each model provider uses a unique inline citation style, which can potentially compromise model anonymity. However, citation formatting impacts how information is presented to and processed by the user, impacting their final votes. To balance these considerations, we introduced <em>‚Äústyle randomization‚Äù</em>: responses are displayed either in a standardized format or in the original format (i.e., the citation style agreed upon with each model provider).</p> <details> <summary>Click to view standardized and original citation styles for each provider.</summary> <div style="margin-top: 1rem;"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/search_arena/04142025/gemini_formatting_example.png" alt="Google's Gemini citation formatting comparison" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;"/> </div> <p>(1) Google's Gemini Formatting: standardized (left), original (right)</p> <div style="margin-top: 1rem;"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/search_arena/04142025/ppl_formatting_example.png" alt="Perplexity's Sonar citation formatting comparison" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;"/> </div> <p>(2) Perplexity‚Äôs Formatting: standardized (left), original (right)</p> <div style="margin-top: 1rem;"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/search_arena/04142025/gpt_formatting_example.png" alt="OpenAI's GPT citation formatting comparison" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;"/> </div> <p>(3) OpenAI's Formatting: standardized (left), original (right)</p> </details> <p>This approach mitigates de-anonymization while allowing us to analyze how citation style impacts user votes (see the citation analyses subsection <a href="#citation_analyses">here</a>). After updating and standardizing citation styles in collaboration with providers, we filtered the dataset to include only battles with the updated styles, resulting in ~7,000 clean samples for leaderboard calculation and further analysis.</p> <p><b>Comparison to Existing Benchmarks.</b> To highlight what makes Search Arena unique, we compare our collected data to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132">LM-Arena</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04368">SimpleQA</a>. As shown in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>, Search Arena prompts focus more on current events, while LM-Arena emphasizes coding/writing, and SimpleQA targets narrow factual questions (e.g., dates, names, specific domains). <a href="#tab1">Tab. 1</a> shows that Search Arena features longer prompts, longer responses, more turns, and more languages compared to SimpleQA‚Äîcloser to natural user interactions seen in LM-Arena.</p> <div id="fig2"> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/search_arena/04142025/topical_distribution_plot.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="450px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2.

Models</h3> <p>Search Arena currently supports 11 models from three providers: Perplexity, Gemini, and OpenAI. Unless specified otherwise, we treat the same model with different citation styles (original vs. standardized) as a single model. <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a> shows the number of battles collected per model used in this iteration of the leaderboard.</p> <p>By default, we use each provider‚Äôs standard API settings. For Perplexity and OpenAI, this includes setting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search_context_size</code> parameter to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">medium</code>, which controls how much web content is retrieved and passed to the model. We also explore specific features by changing the default settings: (1) For OpenAI, we test their geolocation feature in one model variant by passing a country code extracted from the user‚Äôs IP address. (2) For Perplexity and OpenAI, we include variants with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search_context_size</code> set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">high</code>.

Battle counts across 11 models. The distribution is not even as (1) we released models into the arena in batches and (2) filtered votes (described above).</p> <h2 id="leaderboard">2. Leaderboard</h2> <p>We begin by analyzing pairwise win rates‚Äîi.e., the proportion of wins of model A over model B in head-to-head battles. This provides a direct view of model performance differences without aggregating scores. The results are shown in <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>, along with the following observations:</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gemini-2.5-pro-grounding</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ppl-sonar-reasoning-pro-high</code> outperform all other models by a large margin. In direct head-to-head battles <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ppl-sonar-reasoning-pro-high</code> has a slight advantage (53% win rate).</li> <li><code>ppl-sonar-reasoning</code> outperforms the rest of Perplexity‚Äôs models. There‚Äôs no clear difference between <code>ppl-sonar-pro</code> and <code>ppl-sonar-pro-high</code> (52%/48% win rate), and even <code>ppl-sonar</code> beats <code>ppl-sonar-pro-high</code> (60% win rate). This suggests that increasing search context does not necessarily improve performance and may even degrade it.</li> <li>Within OpenAI‚Äôs models, larger search context does not significantly improve performance (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">api-gpt-4o-search</code> vs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">api-gpt-4o-search-high</code>). While adding user location improves performance in head-to-head battles (58% win rate of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">api-gpt-4o-search-high-loc</code> over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">api-gpt-4o-search-high</code>), location-enabled version ranks lower in the leaderboard.</li> </ul> <div id="fig4"> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/search_arena/04142025/main_pairwise_average_win_rate.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4. Pairwise win rates (Model A wins Model B), excluding <code>tie</code> and <code>tie (bothbad)</code> votes.</p> <p>Now we build the leaderboard! Consistent with <a href="https://lmarena.ai/">LM Arena</a>, we apply the Bradley-Terry (BT) model to compute model scores. The resulting BT coefficients are then translated to Elo scale, with the final model scores and rankings displayed in <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> and <a href="#tab3">Tab. 3</a>. The confidence intervals are still wide, which means the leaderboard hasn‚Äôt fully settled and there‚Äôs still some uncertainty. But clear performance trends are already starting to emerge. Consistent with the pairwise win rate analysis in the previous section, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gemini-2.5-pro-grounding</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ppl-sonar-reasoning-pro-high</code> top the leaderboard by a substantial margin. They are followed by models from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ppl-sonar</code> family, with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ppl-sonar-reasoning</code> leading the group. Then comes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gemini-2.0-flash-grounding</code>, and finally OpenAI models with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">api-gpt-4o-search</code> based models outperforming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">api-gpt-4o-mini-search</code>.

Search Arena leaderboard. </p> <h3 id="citation_analyses">Citation Style Analysis</h3> <p>Having calculated the main leaderboard, we can now analyze the effect of citation style on user votes and model rankings. For each battle, we record model A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs citation style ‚Äî original (agreed upon with the providers) vs standardized.</p> <p>First, following the method in <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/style-control/">(Li et al., 2024)</a>, we apply style control and use the citation style indicator variable (1 if standardized, 0 otherwise) as an additional feature in the BT model. The resulting model scores and rankings do not change significantly from <a href="#fig1">the main leaderboard</a>. Although the leaderboard does not change, the corresponding coefficient is positive (0.044) and statistically significant (p&lt;0.05), implying that standardization of citation style has a positive impact on model score.</p> <p>We further investigate the effect of citation style on model performance, by treating each combination of model and citation style as a distinct model (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">api-gpt-4o-search</code> with original style will be different from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">api-gpt-4o-search</code> with standardized citation style). <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a> shows the change in the arena score between the two styles of each model. Overall, we observe increase or no change in score with standardized citations across all models except <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gemini-2.0-flash</code>. However, the differences remain within the confidence intervals (CI), and we will continue collecting data to assess whether the trend converges toward statistical significance.</p> <div id="fig5"> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/search_arena/04142025/og_vs_st.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5.

Three Secrets Behind a WIN</h2> <p>After reviewing the leaderboard‚Äîand showing that the citation style doesn‚Äôt impact results all that much‚Äîyou might be wondering: <em>What features contribute to the model‚Äôs win rate?</em></p> <p>To answer this, we used the framework in¬†<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12323">(Zhong et al., 2022)</a>, a method that automatically proposes and tests hypotheses to identify key differences between two groups of natural language texts‚Äîin this case, human-preferred and rejected model outputs. In our implementation, we asked the model to generate 25 hypotheses and evaluate them, leading to the discovery of <em>three distinguishing factors</em> with statistically significant p-values, shown in <a href="#tab4">Tab. 4</a>.</p> <table id="tab4" style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left;"> <thead> <tr> <th style="padding: 8px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;">Feature</th> <th style="padding: 8px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;">p-value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="padding: 8px;">References to specific known entities or platforms</td> <td style="padding: 8px;">0.0000114</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="padding: 8px;">Frequent use of external citations and hyperlinks</td> <td style="padding: 8px;">0.01036</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="padding: 8px;">Longer, more in-depth answers</td> <td style="padding: 8px;">0.04761</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"> Table 4.

Gemini models are generally the most verbose‚Äî<code>gemini-2.5-pro-grounding</code>, in particular, produces responses nearly twice as long as most Perplexity or OpenAI models. Within the Perplexity and OpenAI families, response length is relatively consistent, with the exception of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ppl-sonar-reasoning-pro-high</code>. <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6 (right)</a> shows the average number of citations per response. Sonar models cite the most, with <code>ppl-sonar-pro-high</code> citing 2-3x more than Gemini models. OpenAI models cite the fewest sources (2-2.5) with little variation within the group.</p> <div id="fig6"> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/search_arena/04142025/lenght_cit_features.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6. Average response length (left) and number of citations (right) per model.</p> <p>In addition to number of citations and response length, we also study the common <em>source domains</em> cited by each model. We categorize retrieved URLs into ten types: YouTube, News (U.S. and foreign), Community &amp; Blogs (e.g., Reddit, Medium), Wikipedia, Tech &amp; Coding (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub), Government &amp; Education, Social Media, Maps, and Academic Journals. <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> shows the domain distribution across providers in two settings: (1) all conversations, and (2) a filtered subset focused on Trump-related prompts.

Below are some findings when controlling for different subsets of control features:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Response length</strong>: Controlling for response length yields a positive and statistically significant coefficient (0.255, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05), indicating that users prefer more verbose responses.</li> <li><strong>Number of citations</strong>: Controlling for citation count also results in a positive and significant coefficient (0.234, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05), suggesting a preference for responses with more cited sources.</li> <li><strong>Citation source categories</strong>: As shown in <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>, citations from <strong>community platforms</strong> (e.g., Reddit, Quora) and <strong>YouTube</strong> have statistically significant positive effects on user votes. The remaining categories have insignificant coefficients.</li> <li><strong>Joint controls</strong>: When controlling for all features, only <strong>response length</strong> and <strong>citation count</strong> remain statistically significant.</li> </ul> <div id="fig8" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/search_arena/04142025/domain_citations_style_control_bootstrap_style_coefs.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 8.

Interestingly, when using all these features as control variables, the top six models all show a reduction in score, while the remaining models are largely unaffected.

Conclusion &amp; What‚Äôs Next</h2> <p>As search-augmented LLMs become increasingly popular, <strong>Search Arena</strong> provides a real-time, in-the-wild evaluation platform driven by crowdsourced human feedback. Unlike static QA benchmarks, our dataset emphasizes current events and diverse real-world queries, offering a more realistic view of how users interact with these systems. Using 7k human votes, we found that <strong>Gemini-2.5-Pro-Grounding</strong> and <strong>Perplexity-Sonar-Reasoning-Pro-High</strong> share the first rank in the leaderboard. User preferences are positively correlated with <strong>response length</strong>, <strong>number of citations</strong>, and <strong>citation sources</strong>. Citation formatting, surprisingly, had minimal impact.</p> <p>We have open-sourced our data (<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmarena-ai/search-arena-v1-7k">ü§ó search-arena-7k</a>) and analysis code (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h7rR7rhePBPuIfaWsVNlW87kv3DLibPS?usp=sharing">‚öôÔ∏è Colab notebook</a>).

Today, we‚Äôre excited to begin sharing community updates in our blog as we continue to make progress towards long-term growth.</p> <h2 id="a-platform-for-the-future">A Platform for the Future</h2> <p>First, let‚Äôs take a trip down memory lane <a href="https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1837233036624286126">when we graduated from LMSys</a> in September 2024 to establish LMArena as an independent platform. With the continued strong partnership with LMSys, we broadened our scope to evaluate not just chatbots but also frontier AI models in areas like <a href="https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1899181467252711593">WebDev Arena</a>, complex tasks, and red-teaming. This expansion allowed us to deepen our insights and provide even more value to the AI community.</p> <p>LMSys has always been more than just a single initiative‚Äîit has served as a research collective behind projects like Vicuna, Chatbot Arena, SGLang, S-LoRA, RouteLLM, and more. As LMArena takes on a life of its own, LMSys will continue to foster new projects and drive open research. If you‚Äôre interested in contributing to the future of AI, there‚Äôs never been a better time to get involved.</p> <h2 id="our-new-discord-server">Our New Discord Server</h2> <p>With this exciting evolution, we recently also launched a dedicated Discord community server earlier this month! Join us at: <a href="https://discord.gg/LMArena">discord.gg/LMArena</a>! This will be the new hub for all things LMArena‚Äîwhere we‚Äôll share insights on ongoing projects, leaderboard updates, and even host community-driven events and surprises.</p> <p>In fact, we recently held our very first community event in the new Discord server, where over 20 members joined us for a walkthrough of the new desktop UI design in alpha. We also dove into community feedback on the voting UI‚Äîas your voices are shaping the future of the platform, and we can‚Äôt wait to continue these conversations with you. It was an exciting opportunity to connect directly with the community, discuss upcoming improvements, and get live input on the changes. We‚Äôre looking forward to hosting many more events like this so <a href="https://forms.gle/mgSodQEa28r8J5cz7">give us your feedback on what you‚Äôd like to see</a>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/new-discord/discord-event.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 85%"/></p> <h2 id="our-vision-for-the-community">Our Vision for the Community</h2> <p>At its core, LMArena is about building together‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre an AI Enthusiast, developer, or AI company, we want to create something that benefits everyone. Free access to models is incredibly valuable for those exploring AI, and the feedback collected through the Arena has proven to be an essential resource in improving AI systems.

We introduce <a href="http://webdev.lmarena.ai">WebDev Arena</a>: a real-time AI coding competition where models go head-to-head in web development challenges.</p> <p>Inspired by <a href="http://lmarena.ai">Chatbot Arena</a>, WebDev Arena allows users to test LLMs in a real-world coding task: building interactive web applications. Users submit a prompt, two LLMs generate web apps, and the community votes on which model performs better.</p> <p>Try out our <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xq_-PGp8gJ8aHUyokrSqL_qZnn8s-UHV?usp=sharing">colab</a> to explore the data and analysis behind WebDev Arena.</p> <h3 id="why-webdev-arena">Why WebDev Arena?</h3> <p>Traditional coding benchmarks like HumanEval focus on solving isolated function-based problems, but real-world coding demands more‚Äîincluding UI generation, handling package dependencies, and structuring complete applications.</p> <p>From an end-user‚Äôs perspective, the setup is simple:</p> <ol> <li>Users submit a prompt (e.g., ‚ÄúBuild a simple chess game‚Äù).</li> <li>Two LLMs generate competing web apps.</li> <li>Users interact with both apps and vote on the better one.</li> <li>Results contribute to a live leaderboard ranking LLMs by performance.</li> </ol> <p>Examples<br/> ‚ÄúCreate a Hacker News clone‚Äù<br/> <img src="/assets/img/blog/webdev_arena/hn-clone.png" alt="Hacker News Clone Example" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1.

In simple terms, the BT model uses win/loss data from pairwise matchups and calculates a score for each model, reflecting its likelihood of winning against others. This ranking system is similar to Elo, commonly used in chess, and competitive games, despite the difference being a player‚Äôs skill rating may evolve over time, while LLMs stay static.</p> <p>Key Takeaways</p> <ul> <li>Claude 3.7 Sonnet currently holds the #1 spot with a 76% average win rate</li> <li>Claude 3.5 Sonnet ranks #2</li> <li>Deepseek R1 ranks #3</li> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/webdev_arena/030625-leaderboard.png" alt="WebDev Arena Leaderboard" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3. Current WebDev Arena leaderboard showing model rankings.</p> <h3 id="how-do-people-use-webdev-arena">How do people use WebDev Arena?</h3> <h4 id="topic-modeling">Topic Modeling</h4> <p>To analyze how people use Webdev Arena, we run the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1chzqjePYnpq08fA3KzyKvSkuzCjojyiE?usp=sharing">topic modeling pipeline</a> on the conversation and human preference data. Results show a diverse range of prompt categories. Overall, prompts can be categorized into 11 broad categories, the largest three being Website Design (15.3%), Game Development (12.1%), and Clone Development (11.6%).</p> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/webdev_arena/cat_broad.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4.

Distribution of narrow categories within broad categories.</p> <p>Using the topic modeling results, we perform LLM performance analysis and observe that models perform differently across categories. Gemini-2.0-flash shows the most dramatic variation, ranking among the lowest in Game Development while performing much better in other categories.</p> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/webdev_arena/rank_broad_cat.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6. Model performance across different broad categories.</p> <p>We calculated the win rates of Gemini 2.0, Claude-3.5-sonnet, O3-mini, and Deepseek-R1 across narrow categories, counting ties as 0.5 wins. Even within the same broad category, models performed differently across specific topics, highlighting their varying strengths. This shows the importance of fine-grained categorical analysis for LLM evaluations.</p> <p>In website design, Deepseek-R1 performed significantly better in Job Board Design but had a noticeably lower performance in Portfolio Website Design. In Game Development, Claude-3.5-sonnet maintained a relatively consistent win rate across most categories, except for a dip in Clicker Game Development. Gemini 2.0 and O3-mini show fluctuating win rates.</p> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/webdev_arena/winrate_web.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 7.

Model win rates across game development categories.</p> <p>One of the main insights from analyzing the data is that a large chunk of the votes are from the sample prompts on the main screen. We found the 5 most asked questions were</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Project Request</th> <th>Number of Times</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>üë®‚Äçüíª Clone of VS Code / Cursor</td> <td>4,189</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Make me a clone of WhatsApp Chat App</td> <td>3,385</td> </tr> <tr> <td>‚ôüÔ∏è Build a game of chess</td> <td>3,154</td> </tr> <tr> <td>üì∞ Clone of Hacker News</td> <td>2,740</td> </tr> <tr> <td>üê¶ Design a modern Twitter profile layout</td> <td>2,544</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Therefore, we deduplicated the data, reducing the votes from 103096 to 61473, and recreated the deduplicated leaderboard. This leaderboard matches the original leaderboard with only a few minor swaps of models (deepseek-v3 and gpt-4o). The elo difference between them is mainly caused by having less data.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Rank</th> <th>Model</th> <th>Original Score</th> <th>Deduplicated Score</th> <th>Delta</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</td> <td>1362.94</td> <td>1311.40</td> <td>51.54</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022</td> <td>1245.85</td> <td>1209.07</td> <td>36.78</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>deepseek-r1</td> <td>1204.70</td> <td>1165.42</td> <td>39.28</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>early-grok-3-so-false</td> <td>1146.99</td> <td>1111.37</td> <td>35.62</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>o3-mini-2025-01-31-high</td> <td>1146.13</td> <td>1119.43</td> <td>26.70</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>o3-mini-2025-01-31-high-so-false</td> <td>1137.20</td> <td>1119.85</td> <td>17.35</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>claude-3-5-haiku-20241022</td> <td>1136.34</td> <td>1112.94</td> <td>23.40</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>o3-mini-2025-01-31-so-false</td> <td>1109.04</td> <td>1083.30</td> <td>25.74</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-01-21-so-false</td> <td>1108.81</td> <td>1099.89</td> <td>8.92</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05</td> <td>1101.89</td> <td>1078.59</td> <td>23.30</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11</td> <td>o3-mini-2025-01-31</td> <td>1099.29</td> <td>1076.50</td> <td>22.78</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12</td> <td>o1-2024-12-17-so-false</td> <td>1054.52</td> <td>1043.16</td> <td>11.36</td> </tr> <tr> <td>13</td> <td>o1-2024-12-17</td> <td>1049.87</td> <td>1035.79</td> <td>14.09</td> </tr> <tr> <td>14</td> <td>o1-mini-2024-09-12</td> <td>1046.62</td> <td>1028.03</td> <td>18.59</td> </tr> <tr> <td>15</td> <td>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</td> <td>1034.30</td> <td>1014.79</td> <td>19.52</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16</td> <td>gemini-2.0-flash-001-so-false</td> <td>1031.71</td> <td>1011.87</td> <td>19.84</td> </tr> <tr> <td>17</td> <td>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219</td> <td>1023.31</td> <td>1005.65</td> <td>17.66</td> </tr> <tr> <td>18</td> <td>gemini-exp-1206</td> <td>1022.30</td> <td>998.24</td> <td>24.07</td> </tr> <tr> <td>19</td> <td>gemini-2.0-flash-exp</td> <td>983.69</td> <td>966.74</td> <td>16.94</td> </tr> <tr> <td>20</td> <td>qwen-max-2025-01-25</td> <td>979.81</td> <td>971.04</td> <td>8.77</td> </tr> <tr> <td>21</td> <td>gpt-4o-2024-11-20</td> <td>964.00</td> <td>964.00</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>22</td> <td>deepseek-v3</td> <td>963.81</td> <td>940.75</td> <td>23.05</td> </tr> <tr> <td>23</td> <td>qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct</td> <td>903.04</td> <td>907.14</td> <td>-4.09</td> </tr> <tr> <td>24</td> <td>gemini-1.5-pro-002</td> <td>893.47</td> <td>891.07</td> <td>2.40</td> </tr> <tr> <td>25</td> <td>llama-v3.1-405b-instruct</td> <td>811.66</td> <td>798.96</td> <td>12.71</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center; padding-top: 10px;">Figure 9.

We will get to this later with the errors that can occur.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th></th> <th>WebDev Arena</th> <th>Chatbot Arena</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Model A</td> <td>36.6%</td> <td>34%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Model B</td> <td>37%</td> <td>34%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tie</td> <td>7.8%</td> <td>16%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bothbad</td> <td>18%</td> <td>16%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>We think this task is much easier to distinguish compared to Chatbot Arena.<br/> To explain for the large number of people voting ‚Äúboth bad‚Äù, we took a look at model failures, when the model either hallucinates a library that does not exist/has not been imported, or writes code that can not compile.<br/> Sometimes, prompts will result in the LLMs outputting buggy code or failing to properly install dependencies.

Distribution of request lengths in tokens.</p> <h3 id="how-we-implemented-webdev-arena">How we implemented WebDev Arena?</h3> <p>One of the key challenges in building WebDev Arena was ensuring that LLMs generate consistent, deployable web applications. To achieve this, we developed a structured output approach that standardizes how models generate web applications.</p> <p>Structured output is a technique that ensures LLM responses adhere to a predefined JSON schema. Rather than allowing models to generate freeform code or text, we constrain their output to match a specific structure. This provides several key benefits:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Type Safety</strong>: Eliminates the need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses</li> <li><strong>Consistent Formatting</strong>: Ensures all models generate code in a standardized way</li> <li><strong>Better Error Handling</strong>: Makes model refusals and errors programmatically detectable</li> <li><strong>Simplified Prompting</strong>: Reduces the need for complex prompting to achieve consistent formatting</li> </ol> <p>Rather than letting models generate code in an unconstrained format, we prompt them to output code in a specific structure that includes:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  // Detailed explanation of the implementation plan
  commentary: string,
  // Template configuration
  template: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  // Dependency management
  additional_dependencies: string[],
  has_additional_dependencies: boolean,
  install_dependencies_command: string,
  // Application configuration
  port: number | null,
  file_path: string,
  // The actual implementation
  code: string
}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This structured format helps ensure:</p> <ol> <li>Clear documentation of the implementation approach through the `commentary` field</li> <li>Proper dependency tracking and installation instructions</li> <li>Consistent file organization within the Next.js project structure</li> <li>Runtime configuration like port numbers are explicitly defined</li> </ol> <h4 id="infrastructure-and-execution-environment">Infrastructure and Execution Environment</h4> <p>Under the hood, WebDev Arena utilizes Amazon‚Äôs Firecracker microVM technology through E2B‚Äôs infrastructure. Each sandbox runs in a lightweight virtual machine that provides enhanced security and workload isolation while maintaining the resource efficiency of containers. These microVMs are managed by a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) using the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), with a minimalist design that excludes unnecessary devices and functionality to reduce memory footprint and attack surface.</p> <p>This infrastructure enables WebDev Arena to run thousands of concurrent LLM-generated applications with complete isolation - each application operates in its own secure environment with dedicated CPU, memory, and networking resources, while maintaining sub-second startup times (~150ms) essential for real-time model comparisons.</p> <h4 id="prompting-strategy-and-system-design">Prompting Strategy and System Design</h4> <p>Our system prompt is designed to create a clear ‚Äúpersona‚Äù for the LLM as an expert frontend engineer with strong UI/UX skills. The prompt includes several critical components:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
    You are an expert frontend React engineer who is also a great UI/UX designer. Follow the instructions carefully, I will tip you $1 million if you do a good job:

    - Think carefully step by step.
    - Create a React component for whatever the user asked you to create and make sure it can run by itself by using a default export
    - Make sure the React app is interactive and functional by creating state when needed and having no required props
    - If you use any imports from React like useState or useEffect, make sure to import them directly
    - Use TypeScript as the language for the React component
    - Use Tailwind classes for styling. DO NOT USE ARBITRARY VALUES (e.g. 'h-[600px]'). Make sure to use a consistent color palette.
    - Make sure you specify and install ALL additional dependencies.
    - Make sure to include all necessary code in one file.
    - Do not touch project dependencies files like package.json, package-lock.json, requirements.txt, etc.
    - Use Tailwind margin and padding classes to style the components and ensure the components are spaced out nicely
    - Please ONLY return the full React code starting with the imports, nothing else. It's very important for my job that you only return the React code with imports. DO NOT START WITH \`\`\`typescript or \`\`\`javascript or \`\`\`tsx or \`\`\`.
    - ONLY IF the user asks for a dashboard, graph or chart, the recharts library is available to be imported, e.g. \`import { LineChart, XAxis, ... } from "recharts"\` &amp; \`&lt;LineChart ...&gt;&lt;XAxis dataKey="name"&gt; ...\`. Please only use this when needed. You may also use shadcn/ui charts e.g. \`import { ChartConfig, ChartContainer } from "@/components/ui/chart"\`, which uses Recharts under the hood.
    - For placeholder images, please use a &lt;div className="bg-gray-200 border-2 border-dashed rounded-xl w-16 h-16" /&gt;

WebDev Arena currently supports Next.js by Vercel, which is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build high-performance web applications with features like hybrid rendering (SSR, SSG, and ISR), React Server Components, and API routes. Next.js is one of the leading web frameworks with 7.2 million weekly npm downloads and ~130,000 Github Stars, which is why we are providing first-class support for it through WebDev Arena.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/webdev_arena/framework-npm-trends.png" alt="Framework NPM Trends" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 12. NPM download trends for popular web frameworks.</p> <h4 id="performance-analysis-single-vs-ensemble-approach">Performance Analysis: Single vs Ensemble Approach</h4> <p>We discovered that different models require different prompting approaches. Our implementation includes specific handling for various model architectures.</p> <p>For models lacking native structured output capabilities, we developed a two-stage generation pipeline: (1) Generate the initial code using the model‚Äôs native format and (2) pass the result through a GPT-4-mini instance to convert it into our structured format.</p> <p>We conducted a systematic ablation study examining structured output‚Äôs impact on model performance in web development tasks. Each model was evaluated in two configurations:</p> <ol> <li>With structured output (using JSON schema constraints)</li> <li>Without structured output (natural language generation)</li> </ol> <p>For example, we evaluated o3-mini (with/without structured output), o1 (with/without structured output), and Gemini models (with/without structured output).</p> <p>Our analysis revealed a consistent performance advantage for models operating without structured output constraints, as evidenced in Figure 13.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Model Variant</th> <th>Arena Score</th> <th>Œî Score</th> <th>Votes</th> <th>95% CI</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>o3-mini-high (w/o structured)</td> <td>1169.19</td> <td>+16.08</td> <td>1,976</td> <td>+12.73/-11.74</td> </tr> <tr> <td>o3-mini-high</td> <td>1153.11</td> <td>-</td> <td>2,982</td> <td>+10.17/-10.51</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="5"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>o3-mini (w/o structured)</td> <td>1129.82</td> <td>+24.12</td> <td>2,688</td> <td>+10.64/-10.42</td> </tr> <tr> <td>o3-mini</td> <td>1105.70</td> <td>-</td> <td>6,388</td> <td>+7.89/-8.59</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="5"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>o1 (w/o structured)</td> <td>1066.29</td> <td>+12.98</td> <td>2,140</td> <td>+12.94/-13.37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>o1 (20241217)</td> <td>1053.31</td> <td>-</td> <td>9,271</td> <td>+4.71/-6.91</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="5"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking-01-21 (w/o structured)</td> <td>1125.98</td> <td>+88.76</td> <td>405</td> <td>+30.49/-27.58</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking-01-21</td> <td>1037.22</td> <td>-</td> <td>1,064</td> <td>+17.04/-17.86</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center; padding-top: 10px;">Figure 13. Comparison of model performance with and without structured output constraints, showing consistent performance advantages for unstructured output across different model architectures.</p> <p>Our experimental results demonstrate that unstructured output configurations consistently outperform their structured counterparts across all tested model architectures, with Arena Score improvements ranging from +12.98 to +88.76 points. These improvements are statistically significant within 95% confidence intervals across all model pairs. The magnitude of this performance impact varies considerably by model architecture - Gemini exhibits the most substantial performance delta (+88.76), while o3-mini-high shows the smallest improvement (+16.08).</p> <p>These findings suggest that while structured output constraints provide benefits for downstream processing and code organization, they may introduce performance limitations in web development tasks. This performance-structure tradeoff appears to be more pronounced in certain model architectures, particularly in the Gemini series, indicating that the impact of structured output constraints may be architecture-dependent.</p> <h3 id="vision-support-for-web-development">Vision Support for Web Development</h3> <p>We‚Äôve extended WebDev Arena to support multi-modal models, enabling evaluation of vision-language capabilities in web development contexts. Currently, seven production models in our evaluation suite support vision inputs: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o, and three variants of Gemini (2.0-flash-thinking, 2.0-pro-exp, and 1.5-pro-002). Each model accepts visual input through our structured schema, which standardizes how images are processed and incorporated into the development workflow.</p> <p>Our implementation supports base64-encoded images and URLs, with vision models demonstrating capabilities in UI replication, design-to-code translation, and visual bug fixing. Early deployments show that models can parse complex visual hierarchies, extract design tokens (colors, spacing, typography), and generate semantically meaningful JSX (JavaScript XML) from screenshots.</p> <p>The integration of vision capabilities has significant implications for web development evaluation. Traditional code generation benchmarks focus solely on text-to-code translation, but real-world development frequently involves visual references and design artifacts. By incorporating vision support, WebDev Arena more accurately reflects practical development workflows while providing quantitative insights into multi-modal code generation performance. We are currently collecting battle data to analyze the impact of visual context on code quality and will release comprehensive benchmarks comparing vision-enabled versus text-only performance across our supported models.</p> <h3 id="limitations-and-future-work">Limitations and Future Work</h3> <p>While WebDev Arena represents a significant step forward in evaluating LLMs for real-world software development, several limitations remain. Unlike existing benchmarks such as HumanEval and CodeXGLUE, which focus on function-level code generation, or SWE-bench, which evaluates issue resolution in open-source repositories, WebDev Arena is currently constrained to Next.js-based React applications. This limitation excludes other widely used frameworks such as Vue, Svelte, and backend technologies like Django or Rails. Furthermore, the single-file constraint does not accurately reflect real-world software engineering workflows, where projects are typically structured across multiple files with modular architectures. Another challenge is error handling‚Äîour analysis indicates that 18% of user votes fall into the ‚Äúboth bad‚Äù category, often due to dependency resolution failures, incorrect state management, or TypeScript-related compilation errors. A more sophisticated error classification framework would enhance the interpretability of failure cases and inform improvements in model reliability.</p> <p>Future work will extend WebDev Arena to a broader range of software engineering tasks, encompassing full-stack development and non-web domains to better capture the diverse challenges of real-world coding. Unlike traditional benchmarks that focus on algorithmic correctness or isolated bug fixes, our approach evaluates LLMs in the context of complete application development, emphasizing deployment-ready implementations. We also plan to refine our human evaluation methodology, enhance model ranking with more granular error diagnostics, and investigate the impact of multimodal capabilities, particularly in UI-to-code translation. By addressing these limitations, we aim to establish WebDev Arena as a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs in practical software engineering contexts, bridging the gap between academic evaluation and real-world application development.</p> <h3 id="citation">Citation</h3> <div class="language-bibtex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">@misc</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">vichare2025webdev</span><span class="p">,</span>

Here's an analysis based on the provided context:</p> <hr/> <h3>1. Enhanced <code>fetch_validated</code> Method in <code>Blackbox</code></h3> <p>In <strong>version 0.4.0.0</strong>, the <code>Blackbox</code> provider introduces a more complex and robust mechanism for fetching and validating the <code>validated_value</code>. This involves:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Fetching multiple JavaScript files</strong> from the <code>https://www.blackbox.ai</code> or <code>https://api.blackbox.ai</code> endpoints.</li> <li><strong>Regex-based parsing of UUIDs</strong> in JavaScript files to extract the <code>validated_value</code>.</li> <li><strong>Checking the context around the UUID</strong> to ensure it is valid.</li> <li><strong>Retries and handling multiple URLs</strong>, which adds overhead.</li> </ul> <p>This validation mechanism includes additional asynchronous calls and error handling. While it improves reliability, it significantly increases the response time.</p> <p><strong>Comparison to version 0.3.9.7:</strong> The earlier version likely used a simpler or cached approach for this process, avoiding the need to repeatedly process JavaScript files and perform context validation.</p> <hr/> <h3>2. Increased Error Handling and Retrying</h3> <p>The new implementation introduces more robust error-handling mechanisms, including:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Retry loops</strong> for fetching JavaScript files and API calls.</li> <li><strong>Exponential backoff with random delays</strong> when processing requests.</li> <li><strong>Fallbacks for cached values</strong> if validation fails.</li> </ul> <p>While this improves reliability and stability, each retry and delay adds to the total processing time.</p> <hr/> <h3>3. Web Search Integration</h3> <p>The <code>create_async_generator</code> function now has an optional <strong>web search</strong> feature:</p> <ul> <li>If <code>web_search</code> is enabled, the provider calls an external search engine (via <code>get_search_message</code>) to refine the user's query.</li> <li>Although <code>web_search</code> is optional, if enabled, it introduces significant latency due to network calls and extra processing.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3>4. Increased Complexity in Request Data Preparation</h3> <p>The new implementation constructs a more detailed payload for the API request:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Agent modes</strong> (e.g., <code>agentMode</code>, <code>trendingAgentMode</code>) are retrieved and included in the payload.</li> <li><strong>Model-specific settings</strong>, including image generation and other configurations, are passed in the data.</li> <li><strong>Image processing</strong> (if images are included) involves converting to data URIs.</li> </ul> <p>This additional processing step before sending the request increases the latency.</p> <hr/> <h3>5. More Advanced Delay and Retry Mechanisms</h3> <p>When an API request fails, the system uses:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Exponential backoff delays:</strong> <code>delay * (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)</code></li> <li><strong>Retries (default <code>max_retries=3</code>):</strong> Every failed request results in subsequent retries.</li> </ul> <p>These features, while improving resilience, can slow down the overall response time if the API is unreliable or under heavy load.</p> <hr/> <h3>6. Additional Debugging and Logging</h3> <p>The new version includes enhanced debugging and logging mechanisms (<code>debug.log</code>):</p> <ul> <li>Each step, including validation, retries, and errors, is logged.</li> <li>While useful for debugging, this can also slightly slow down execution, especially in development or verbose logging environments.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3>7. Potential API Changes on Blackbox's Side</h3> <p>If the Blackbox API itself has undergone changes between the two versions, such as stricter validation or slower endpoints, this could also contribute to the slowdown. The need to fetch and validate <code>validated_value</code> repeatedly suggests that the newer version is designed to handle a more restrictive or rate-limited API.</p> <hr/> <h3>8. Cache Mechanism vs. Real-Time Validation</h3> <p>In version <strong>0.3.9.7</strong>, the <code>validated_value</code> may have been cached and reused across requests, reducing overhead. In version <strong>0.4.0.0</strong>, the <code>_load_cached_value</code> and <code>_save_cached_value</code> methods are still present, but more emphasis is placed on real-time validation through <code>fetch_validated</code>, which is inherently slower.</p> <hr/> <h3>Summary of Reasons for Slowdown</h3> <ol> <li><strong>More Robust <code>fetch_validated</code> Method:</strong> Repeatedly fetching and parsing JavaScript files for UUID validation adds significant overhead.</li> <li><strong>Increased Error Handling and Retries:</strong> New retry mechanisms and delays increase resilience but add latency.</li> <li><strong>Optional Web Search:</strong> If enabled, it introduces additional network calls and processing time.</li> <li><strong>Enhanced Payload Preparation:</strong> More detailed request data adds preprocessing time.</li> <li><strong>Reliance on Real-Time Validation:</strong> Real-time validation of the <code>validated_value</code> is slower than relying on cached values.</li> <li><strong>API Changes on Blackbox's Side:</strong> Stricter validation or rate-limiting by the Blackbox API could also be contributing.</li> </ol> <hr/> <h3>Recommendations to Improve Speed</h3> <ol> <li><strong>Cache the <code>validated_value</code>:</strong> Implement more aggressive caching and reduce reliance on real-time validation.</li> <li><strong>Optimize the <code>fetch_validated</code> process:</strong> Limit retries or check for updated values less frequently.</li> <li><strong>Disable features like <code>web_search</code>:</strong> Only enable it if explicitly needed.</li> <li><strong>Reduce retry attempts and exponential backoff delays:</strong> Optimize for faster error recovery in non-critical use cases.</li> </ol> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </details> <h3 id="retriever-control">Retriever Control</h3> <p>Just like style, the retrievers too have an effect on model answer.

We adopt its <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/extended-arena/"><strong>statistical extension</strong></a> to evaluate the additional subparts‚Äìthe retrievers‚Äìby integrating them as extra features just like the answer models. Each retriever feature takes values from {-1, 0, 1}, indicating whether it was active in the file retrieval for model_a, neither/both, or model_b, respectively. By performing Logistic Regression on these additional retriever features along with the original model features, we obtain coefficients that are later scaled to become the leaderboard scores. <img src="/assets/img/blog/repochat_arena/PIC_winrates.png" alt="Model Pairwise Winrates" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 8.

However, understanding what people ask, how they structure prompts, and how models perform isn‚Äôt straightforward. Raw text data is messy and complex. Analyzing small samples is feasible, but identifying trends in large datasets is challenging. This isn‚Äôt just our problem. Anyone dealing with unstructured data, e.g. long texts and images, faces the same question: how do you organize it to extract meaningful insights?</p> <p>To address this, we developed a topic modeling pipeline and the <strong>Arena Explorer</strong>. This pipeline organizes user prompts into distinct topics, structuring the text data hierarchically to enable intuitive analysis. We believe this tool for hierarchical topic modeling can be valuable to anyone analyzing complex text data.</p> <div class="l-page" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"> <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; height: 0; padding-bottom: 70%; margin-bottom: 20px"> <iframe src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public-arena-no-cors/index.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="yes" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: white;" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </div> </div> <p>In this blog post, we will cover:</p> <ul> <li>Analysis of LLM performance insights received from Arena Explorer.</li> <li>Details of how we created the Explorer, transforming a large dataset of user conversations into an exploratory tool.</li> <li>Ways to fine-tune and improve topic models.</li> </ul> <p>Check out the pipeline in this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1chzqjePYnpq08fA3KzyKvSkuzCjojyiE?usp=sharing">colab notebook</a>, and try it out yourself.</p> <p>We also published the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmarena-ai/arena-explorer-preference-100k">dataset</a> we used. This dataset contains 100k leaderboard conversation data, the largest prompt dataset with human preferences we have every released!</p> <h2 id="insights">Insights</h2> <p><strong>Model Performance Comparison</strong></p> <p>In our previous <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/arena-category/">blog post</a>, we conducted an in-depth categorical analysis and discussed key insights. That analysis was based on manually defined categories in Chatbot Arena. The results showed that language models perform differently across categories. With our topic modeling pipeline, we can now analyze model performance across categories more efficiently and dive deeper into specific topics.</p> <p>Compared to <em>Tech Programming</em>, model rankings for the other two largest broad categories, <em>Creative Writing</em> and <em>Puzzles &amp; Math</em>, shifted significantly.</p> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/rank_broad_cat.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1. Tech Programming vs. Creative Writing vs. Puzzles Chatbot Arena ranking of the top 10 ranked models in Tech Programming.</p> <p>Claude performed better than Gemini in <em>Tech Programming</em>, while Gemini outperformed Claude in <em>Creative Writing</em>.

Tech Programming vs. Creative Writing Chatbot Arena Score computed using the Bradley-Terry model.</p> <p><strong>Diving into Narrow Categories</strong></p> <p>Model performance analysis can be broken down into more specific categories based on win rates. We calculated the win rates of Gemini 1.5, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 across the narrow categories, treating ties as 0.5 wins. Gemini 1.5 performed best in <em>Entrepreneurship and Business Strategy</em> but had a noticeably lower win rate in <em>Songwriting and Playlist Creation</em>. In contrast, GPT-4o maintained a relatively consistent win rate across most categories, except for a dip in <em>Entrepreneurship and Business Strategy</em>. Claude 3.5 excelled in <em>Web Development</em> and <em>Linux &amp; Shell Scripting</em> but had lower win rates in other, less technical categories.</p> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/winrate_narrow.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3. Model win rates in the eight largest narrow categories.</p> <p>Even within the same broad category, model performance varies slightly. For example, within <em>Tech Programming</em>, GPT-4o showed a lower win rate in <em>GPU and CPU Performance and Comparison</em> compared to other categories. Within <em>Creative Writing</em>, Gemini had a significantly higher win rate in <em>Genshin Impact Parody Adventures</em>.</p> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/winrate_tech.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4.

Model win rates in the eight largest narrow categories within Creative Writing.</p> <p>Note: Since models compete against different sets of opponents, win rates are only meaningful when compared within the same model. Therefore, we do not directly compare win rates across different models.</p> <h2 id="topic-modeling-pipeline">Topic Modeling Pipeline</h2> <p>We used the leaderboard conversation data between June 2024 and August 2024. To facilitate clustering in later steps, we selected prompts tagged in English and removed duplicate prompts. The final dataset contains around 52k prompts.</p> <p>To group the prompts into narrow categories, we used a topic modeling pipeline with <a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html">BERTopic</a>, similar to the one presented in our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132">(Chiang, 2024)</a>. We performed the following steps.</p> <ol> <li>We create embeddings for user prompts with SentenceTransformers‚Äô model (all-mpnet-base-v2), transforming prompts into representation vectors.</li> <li>To reduce the dimensionality of embeddings, we use UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)</li> <li>We use the density distribution-based clustering algorithm HDBSCAN to identify topic clusters with a minimum clustering size of 20.</li> <li>We select 20 example prompts per cluster. They were chosen from the ones with high HDBSCAN probability scores (top 20% within their respective clusters). For clarity, we choose those with fewer than 100 words.</li> <li>To come up with cluster names, we feed the example prompts into ChatGPT-4o to give the category a name and description.</li> <li>We reduced all outliers using probabilities obtained from HDBSCAN and then embeddings of each outlier prompt. This pipeline groups the prompts into narrow categories, each with 20 example prompts.</li> </ol> <div> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/intertopic_distance.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="700px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6. The intertropical distance map shows the narrow clusters identified by BERTopic. The size of the circles is proportional to the amount of prompts in the cluster.</p> <p>We consolidate the initial narrow categories into broad categories for more efficient and intuitive exploration. We perform a second round of this topic modeling pipeline on the summarized category names and descriptions generated earlier. The steps are almost identical to before. Except for steps 4 and 5, we use all category names in a cluster for summarization instead of selecting examples.</p> <h3 id="tuning-topic-clusters">Tuning Topic Clusters</h3> <p>Topic clusters are not always accurate. Some prompts may not be placed in the most suitable cluster, and the same applies to specific categories. Many factors influence the final clustering:</p> <ol> <li>Embedding models used to generate vector representations for prompts</li> <li>Sampled example prompts used to assign cluster names</li> <li>BERTopic model parameters that affect the number of clusters, such as n_neighbors in UMAP and min_cluster_size in HDBSCAN</li> <li>Outlier reduction methods</li> </ol> <p><strong>How do we improve and fine-tune the clusters?</strong> Embedding models play a major role in clustering accuracy since they are used to train the clustering model. We compared two models on a 10k sample dataset: Sentence Transformer‚Äôs all-mpnet-base-v2 and OpenAI‚Äôs text-embedding-3-large, a more recent model. According to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">MTEB Leaderboard</a>, text-embedding-3-large performs better on average (57.77). The clustering results are noticeably different.</p> <p>With text-embedding-3-large, the broad category distribution is more balanced. In contrast, all-mpnet-base-v2 produced a large <em>Tech Programming</em> category. Zooming in on this category, we found that AI-related clusters were merged into <em>Tech Programming</em> when using all-mpnet-base-v2, whereas text-embedding-3-large formed a separate AI-related category. Choosing which result to use depends on human preference.</p> <div class="l-page" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/embedding_mpnet_broad.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="700px" width="100%"></iframe> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/embedding_mpnet_tech.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="700px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 7 &amp; 8. Broad categories and specific categories in ‚ÄúTech Programming‚Äù summarized using all-mpnet-base-v2.</p> <div class="l-page" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/embedding_openai_broad.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="700px" width="100%"></iframe> <iframe src="/assets/img/blog/explorer/embedding_openai_tech.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="700px" width="100%"></iframe> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 9 &amp; 10. Broad categories and specific categories in ‚ÄúTech Programming‚Äù summarized using text-embedding-3-large.</p> <p>Beyond embedding models, adjusting parameters and outlier reduction methods helps refine the clusters. For example, we increased the min_cluster_size parameter to adjust the broad clusters. Before, several broad categories had similar meanings. By increasing this parameter, we reduced the number of clusters, resulting in more distinctive categories.</p> <h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next?</h2> <p>We will add more features to our explorer that provide insights into the connection between model performance and prompt category, such as model performance per category.</p> <p>We would love to hear your feedback and how you are using the pipeline to derive insights!</p> <h2 id="citation">Citation</h2> <div class="language-bibtex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">@misc</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">tang2025explorer</span><span class="p">,</span>

Copilot Arena is no different: Copilot Arena enables not only paired <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/copilot-arena/">code completions</a> but also paired code edits as well. Unlike code completions‚Äîwhich automatically appear after short pauses‚Äîcode edits are manually triggered by highlighting a code snippet and then writing a short task description. In Copilot Arena specifically, two suggestions (presented as code diffs) are provided and the user is able to vote between them.</p> <p>To date, Copilot Arena has been downloaded over 8.5k times on the VSCode Marketplace! We recently released the Copilot Arena live leaderboard for code completions on lmarena.ai and now the code edit leaderboard, which has 3K votes across 6 top models.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena_edits/demo.png" alt="Demo of Edits" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1.

This may however be correlated with model quality.</li> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena_edits/winrate_matrix.png" alt="Model win rate matrix" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2.

Here, we will focus on code edit usage.</p> <p><strong>How long are the prompts that people write?</strong> We find that the median prompt length is 34 characters and mean is 139 characters. Most are fairly short and thus depend on the context that is highlighted. In comparison to the chat messages sent by users in Chatbot Arena, user prompts for inline edits tend to be much shorter. The model must instead mostly focus on test the model‚Äôs ability to infer user goals based on the context (e.g., the highlighted code snippet).</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena_edits/prompt_char_length.png" alt="Copilot Arena prompt length distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3. Distribution of prompt character lengths.</p> <p><strong>What context lengths are we looking at?</strong> We look at the distribution of code-to-edit token lengths, as computed by the number of highlighted tokens. The median is 138 tokens and the mean is 647 tokens. While there are some outliers, this indicates that most people are highlighting targeted portions of code for edits as this is much shorter than the full file length which is typically closer to 4.5k tokens on average.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena_edits/code_to_edit_token.png" alt="Copilot Arena highlighted length distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4. Number of highlighted tokens</p> <p><strong>What kind of edits are people trying to make?</strong> We find users write prompts for code edits in multiple languages, predominantly English but also in Russian, Chinese, and Spanish. Users typically write prompts using informal language and the prompts are typically directed towards addressing a specific goal. The distribution can be found in Figure 5.</p> <p>The main categories include:</p> <ol> <li>Resolve errors <ul> <li>E.g., ‚Äúfix the syntax please‚Äù, ‚ÄúCannot read properties of null (reading ‚Äòimage‚Äô)‚Äù</li> </ul> </li> <li>Optimize code <ul> <li>E.g., ‚Äúcreate a function to validate emailid and phone using regular expression‚Äù, ‚Äúadd style to pokemon-image‚Äù</li> </ul> </li> <li>Write code or build on existing code <ul> <li>E.g., ‚Äúcreate a node api to send an email‚Äù, ‚Äúcreate a function to validate emailid and phone using regular expression‚Äù</li> </ul> </li> <li>Code translation <ul> <li>E.g., ‚Äúchange this to react compound‚Äù, ‚Äúconvert this to oops‚Äù</li> </ul> </li> <li>Test code <ul> <li>E.g., ‚Äúcreate test cases‚Äù, ‚Äúvalidate the input‚Äù</li> </ul> </li> <li>Styling and formatting <ul> <li>E.g., ‚Äúmake this code beautiful‚Äù, ‚Äúformat that to be compatible with .md‚Äù</li> </ul> </li> <li>Documentation and explanation <ul> <li>E.g., ‚Äúexplain this code‚Äù, ‚Äúadd docstring‚Äù</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <div class="l-page"> <div id="waffle-container" style="width: 100%; height: 700px; display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <svg id="waffle-chart"></svg> </div> </div> <d-figure> <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script> <script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){const t=[{category:"Write/build code",count:3564,percentage:47,color:"#4f46e5"},{category:"Resolve errors",count:3330,percentage:43.9,color:"#7c3aed"},{category:"Optimize code",count:399,percentage:5.3,color:"#a855f7"},{category:"Documentation",count:99,percentage:1.3,color:"#d946ef"},{category:"Styling/formatting",count:98,percentage:1.3,color:"#ec4899"},{category:"Code translation",count:72,percentage:.9,color:"#f43f5e"},{category:"Test code",count:16,percentage:.2,color:"#fb7185"}],e=d3.select("#waffle-chart"),o={top:50,right:50,bottom:150,left:50},r=700,a=500,n=400;e.attr("width",r).attr("height",a+o.top+o.bottom);const c=e.append("g").attr("transform",`translate(${(r-n)/2},${o.top})`),l=n/10,s=2;let i=0;const p=[];for(let e=0;e<10;e++)for(let o=0;o<10;o++){let r=0,a=null;for(const e of t)if(i<(r+=e.percentage)){a=e;break}p.push({row:e,col:o,category:a.category,color:a.color,count:a.count,percentage:a.percentage}),i++}const d=d3.select("body").append("div").attr("class","tooltip").style("opacity",0).style("position","absolute").style("background-color","white").style("border","1px solid #ddd").style("border-radius","3px").style("padding","10px").style("pointer-events","none");c.selectAll(".square").data(p).join("rect").attr("class","square").attr("x",t=>t.col*(l+s)).attr("y",t=>t.row*(l+s)).attr("width",l-2).attr("height",l-2).attr("fill",t=>t.color).on("mouseover",(t,e)=>{d.transition().duration(200).style("opacity",.9),d.html(`${e.category}: ${e.count}`).style("left",t.pageX+10+"px").style("top",t.pageY-28+"px")}).on("mouseout",()=>{d.transition().duration(500).style("opacity",0)}),e.append("text").attr("x",r/2).attr("y",30).attr("text-anchor","middle").style("font-size","16px").style("font-weight","bold").text("Code Activities Distribution");const g=220,y=2,u=25,f=c.append("g").attr("transform",`translate(${(n-g*y)/2}, ${a-60})`);t.length;t.forEach((t,e)=>{const o=Math.floor(e/y),r=e%y,a=f.append("g").attr("transform",`translate(${r*g}, ${o*u})`);a.append("rect").attr("width",15).attr("height",15).attr("fill",t.color).attr("rx",2),a.append("text").attr("x",25).attr("y",12).style("font-size","14px").text(`${t.category} (${t.percentage}%)`)}),f.selectAll(".legend-item").on("mouseover",(t,e)=>{d.transition().duration(200).style("opacity",.9),d.html(`${e.category}: ${e.count}`).style("left",t.pageX+10+"px").style("top",t.pageY-28+"px")}).on("mouseout",()=>{d.transition().duration(500).style("opacity",0)})});</script> </d-figure> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5.

A few weeks ago, we launched <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=copilot-arena.copilot-arena&amp;ssr=false#overview">Copilot Arena</a>, a <strong>free</strong> AI coding assistant that provides paired responses from different state-of-the-art LLMs. We first introduced paired code completions and more recently rolled out inline editing-a feature where users can highlight code segments, write a prompt, and receive two diff-based suggestions for modifying that code.</p> <p>Thus far, Copilot Arena has been downloaded 2.5K times on the VSCode Marketplace, served over 100K completions, and accumulated over 10K code completion battles. In this blog post, we‚Äôll cover:</p> <ul> <li><a href="#initial-leaderboard-and-results">Initial Leaderboard and Results</a>. Our preliminary results for the code completions leaderboard and analysis of model tiers.</li> <li><a href="#how-do-people-use-copilot-arena">Copilot Arena Usage</a>.

Details of how we use chat models like Claude Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o to perform code completions (spoiler alert, we generate code snippets and post-process!).</li> </ul> <h2 id="initial-leaderboard-and-results">Initial Leaderboard and Results</h2> <p>As an initial set of models, we selected 9 of the best models across multiple model providers that include both open, code-specific, and commercial models. To ensure a fair comparison between models, we do the following‚Ä¶</p> <ul> <li>We randomize whether models appear at the top or bottom for each completion along with which models are paired for each battle.</li> <li>We show both completions at the same time. This means that a faster model completion needs to wait for the slower model.</li> <li>Many of the models with superior coding capabilities are chat models. As discussed later in the post, we optimize the prompts so they can perform code completions. We manually verified there were no significant formatting issues in the data collected.</li> <li>We set the same max number of output tokens, input tokens, top-p, and temperature (unless specified by the model provider).</li> </ul> <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: fit-content;"> <table class="tg"> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th style="text-align: center;">Arena Score</th> <th style="text-align: center;">Confidence Intervals</th> <th style="text-align: center;">Median Latency (s)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr style="background-color: #EFBF04; color: black"> <td>Deepseek V2.5</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1074</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+16/-11</td> <td style="text-align: center;">2.13</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #EFBF04; color: black"> <td>Claude Sonnet 3.5 (06/20)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1053</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+18/-17</td> <td style="text-align: center;">2.29</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #C0C0C0; color: black"> <td>Codestral (05/24)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1046</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+12/-10</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1.01</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #C0C0C0; color: black"> <td>Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1024</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+17/-15</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1.12</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #CD7F32; color: black"> <td>GPT-4o (08/06)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1016</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+17/-20</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.75</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #CD7F32; color: black"> <td>Gemini-1.5-Pro-002</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1014</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+19/-18</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1.44</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #CD7F32; color: black"> <td>Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1013</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+14/-15</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.88</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #CD7F32; color: black"> <td>Gemini-1.5-Flash-002</td> <td style="text-align: center;">1005</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+16/-22</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.55</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #E8E8E8; color: black"> <td>GPT-4o-mini (07/18)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">962</td> <td style="text-align: center;">+17/-15</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.74</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Table 1.

Fraction of model A wins for all battles</p> <h3 id="the-effect-of-latency">The Effect of Latency</h3> <p>While the Arena scores (Table 1) do not explicitly factor in model latency since both completions are shown simultaneously, we explore whether Arena Scores correlate with latency. We include median latency as a separate column in the results. In general, we find that people don‚Äôt necessarily prefer faster models. However, this may be partially because code completions are only generated in Copilot Arena after a user pauses.</p> <h2 id="how-do-people-use-copilot-arena">How do people use Copilot Arena?</h2> <p><strong>What kind of languages do people code in?</strong><br/> Most current Copilot Arena users code in Python, followed by javascript/typescript, html/markdown, and C++. This statistic is determined based on the file extension.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena/filetype_dist.png" alt="Copilot Arena filetype distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3. Filetypes requested in Copilot Arena. Filetypes are determined based on file extension.</p> <p><strong>What kind of context lengths are we looking at?</strong><br/> The mean context length is 1002 tokens and the median is 560 tokens. This is much longer than tasks considered in existing static benchmarks. For example, human eval has a median length of ~100 tokens.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena/context_length_dist.png" alt="Copilot Arena context length distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4.

We are still analyzing our data, but here are some of our insights.</p> <ul> <li><em>Are people even reading the completions? Or are they just instinctively pressing Tab?</em> Users take a median of 7 seconds to view the response and then select a response. As such, we believe that people are indeed reading the completions.</li> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena/vote_times.png" alt="Copilot Arena Vote time distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5. Distribution of user response times. Most users are taking a few seconds to read the responses.</p> <ul> <li><em>Does position bias affect models equally?</em> Surprisingly, no! For example, when shown as the bottom completion, Sonnet-3.5 is accepted 23.4% of the time compared to only 12.8% of the time for Gemini Flash. On the other hand, they are accepted at roughly the same rate when shown as the top completion (86.7% vs 85% respectively). We are still exploring the reasons behind this phenomenon and will continue our analysis in a future post.</li> </ul> <p><strong>How many people are regular users?</strong> In total, we have had votes from 833 unique users and between 200-250 daily active users.</p> <p><strong>How do you handle ties in Arena?</strong> We do not currently have an option for people to select that both responses are equally good (or bad).</p> <p><strong>How do you handle models pre-trained on FiM?</strong> For Deepseek V2.5 and Codestral, we use their API which directly allows for FiM capabilities.</p> <h2 id="how-do-we-prompt-chat-models-to-perform-code-completions">How Do We Prompt Chat Models to Perform Code Completions?</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/copilot_arena/instruct_error.png" alt="Copilot Arena filetype distribution" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6. (Top) Example of code completion that requires infilling capabilities. (Bottom) Example of formatting issue that chat models encounters when prompted to complete code given the prefix and suffix.</p> <p>During real development processes, developers frequently modify or expand on existing code, rather than only write code in a left-to-right manner. As such, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05999">‚Äúfill in the middle‚Äù</a> (FiM) capabilities when generating code completions are critical for any models to be used in Copilot Arena. Many code-specific models, including DeepSeek and Codestral, are specifically trained to perform FiM. However, most models in Copilot Arena are not because they are chat models, and thus, they struggle to appropriately format a completion when provided with the prefix and suffix. We explore a simple prompting trick that allows chat models to perform code completions with high success.</p> <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: fit-content;"> <table class="tg"> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th style="text-align: center;">PSM</th> <th style="text-align: center;">SPM</th> <th style="text-align: center;">Mask</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-sonnet</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.67 (+0.16)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.66 (+0.15)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.66 (+0.14)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-2024-08-06</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.71 (+0.02)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.55 (+0.19)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.62 (+0.12)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-mini-2024-07-18</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.18 (+0.39)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.12 (+0.54)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.15 (+0.36)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gemini-1.5-pro-001</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.38 (+0.28)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.34 (+0.36)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.43 (-0.04)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gemini-1.5-flash-001</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.34 (+0.24)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.27 (+0.37)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.36 (+0.19)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.14 (+0.46)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.15 (+0.48)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">0.12 (+0.27)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Table 2: Percentage of well-formatted code completions with different prompt templates (PSM, SPM, Mask). We denote the gain by our prompting method in parentheses.</p> <p><strong>Evaluation Set-up.</strong> To verify that chat models would indeed struggle to perform FiM, we use the <a href="https://github.com/openai/human-eval-infilling">HumanEval-infilling</a> dataset as an imperfect proxy to benchmark chat models‚Äô FiM capabilities. We adopt three prompt templates considered in prior work (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04814">Gong et al.</a>) like Prefix-suffix-middle (PSM), Suffix-prefix-middle (SPM), and Mask. Instead of measuring pass@1, we only consider whether the returned infilled code is formatted correctly.</p> <p><strong>Chat models can‚Äôt naively FiM.</strong> Table 2 shows that standard prompt templates are insufficient for chat models to complete FiM tasks. This is not necessarily an indication that models cannot code as clearly many SOTA chat models are proficient coders. Instead, the vast majority of the errors resulted from issues in formatting or duplicate code segments rather than logical errors, indicating that these models cannot generalize their code outputs to FiM tasks. While it is not feasible to retrain these models, we explore alternative approaches via prompting to enable models to complete FiM tasks.</p> <p><strong>Our solution significantly reduces formatting errors.</strong> Instead of forcing chat models to output code in a format unaligned with its training (e.g. FiM), we allow the model to generate code snippets, which is a more natural format, and then post-process them into a FiM completion. Our approach is as follows: in addition to the same prompt templates above, the models are provided with instructions to begin by re-outputting a portion of the prefix and similarly end with a portion of the suffix. We then match portions of the output code in the input and delete the repeated code. As you can see in Table 2, the models make much fewer formatting issues. These benefits hold regardless of the prompt template.</p> <h3 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next?</h3> <ul> <li><strong>More results and analyses:</strong> We‚Äôre working on adding new metrics that will provide more insight into how useful models are (e.g., code persistence), and more fine-grain analyses to understand why some models are preferred by users over others. We will also release a leaderboard for inline editing once we have collected enough votes!</li> <li><strong>Opportunities to contribute to Copilot Arena:</strong> While our initial prompting efforts are proving to be usable in practice, we welcome suggestions for prompt improvements.

This raises the question: which model is best for a specific use-case? To offer deeper insights into this question, we have been adding various categories to our leaderboard. Over time, we‚Äôve introduced a wide array of categories, including hard prompts, instruction-following, math prompts, coding prompts, refusal handling, longer queries, multi-turn conversations, various languages, and style control. Today, we‚Äôre excited to announce the release of a new category: creative writing!</p> <p>In this blog post, we‚Äôll explain:</p> <ul> <li>Key insights from our categorical analysis, including how the topic distribution varies with time</li> <li>The deployment process for new categories</li> <li>The definition of each category currently in Chatbot Arena</li> <li>How the community can contribute to improve and add categories</li> </ul> <h2 id="why-categorize">Why Categorize?</h2> <p>Language models don‚Äôt shine equally in different areas. Some tasks may require the precise execution of instructions, while others push the model‚Äôs ability to reason through complex math problems or handle long, multi-turn conversations. By grouping tasks into categories, we can assess models‚Äô strengths and weaknesses in a more granular way. We acknowledge that a high-ranking on the overall leaderboard doesn‚Äôt imply the model will excel across the board in every situation.

Unlike straightforward writing tasks, creative writing prompts involve originality, artistic expression, and often, a different kind of thinking compared to more technical prompts. For instance, while ‚Äúwrite a thank-you email‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt qualify as creative writing, ‚Äúwrite a humorously sarcastic thank-you email‚Äù would. The category encompasses traditional creative formats (stories, poems, lyrics) and extends to areas like joke creation, meme explanation, and responses to philosophical questions that can‚Äôt be answered through simple fact-checking.</p> <p>We note that this category is in a sense, orthogonal, to our previously introduced categories, such as Math and Coding. As such, we find interesting differences in rankings when looking at creative writing. Studying categories like creativity is important‚Äî the ranking signal on this type of prompts are innately dependent on human preference, and are difficult to obtain from traditional close-ended benchmarks without human-in-the-loop.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/creative_prompt_diff_1.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 1: Ranking deltas from Overall Leaderboard to Creative Writing Leaderboard.</p> <h2 id="defining-and-assigning-the-categories">Defining and assigning the categories</h2> <p>So, how is the creative writing category created? It all starts with the definition. A category can be thought of as a grouping of prompts based on the common skills required to respond effectively. Categories can be well defined (e.g. prompts longer than 500 tokens) or more ambiguous. One prompt could also be classified with multiple categories. Consider the ‚Äúcreative‚Äù category‚Äî how can we even define prompts that require creativity? In the following sections, we will walk you through how we construct a category in Chatbot Arena.</p> <p>First, we define each category with a checklist. If enough items in the checklist are satisfied, the prompt is labeled as an element of that category. For ‚ÄúCreative Writing‚Äù that checklist looks like this:</p> <p>What qualifies as creative writing?</p> <ul> <li>Prompts requiring originality and imagination</li> <li>Tasks involving emotional or artistic expression</li> <li>Requests for unique perspectives or interpretative responses</li> <li>Writing that goes beyond factual reporting or analysis</li> </ul> <p>We include example creative writing prompts in the Appendix <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>. Additionally we also detail the definitions of other categories, including Math, Hard Prompt, Instruction-Following, Code, and various languages in the Appendix <a href="#more-category-definitions">link</a>.</p> <p>Defining categories is one thing‚Äîdeploying them at scale is another. With over 2 million prompts, category classification cannot be done by hand. While some categories (eg. Language, Code) can use heuristic algorithms for fast classification, others (eg. Creative Writing, Hard Prompt) cannot. For categories like Creative Writing, we build a fast and robust category classification system using an LLM. We prompt the LLM with the category checklist, and judge whether the prompt satisfies the checklist.</p> <p>Of course, it is crucial to verify whether the classifications made by the LLM judge are within the desired specifications. To do this we check the classification performance on a wide sample of Chatbot Arena prompts. As a whole, we call this auto-evaluation pipeline Label Bench, which we define in detail below.</p> <h3 id="label-bench">Label Bench</h3> <p>The Label Bench framework is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Initial Prompt Design: An prototype system prompt is carefully crafted based on a determined definition of the category. Extensive manual testing should be conducted to ensure the system prompt is high-quality.</li> <li>Ground Truth Labeling: Random sample 2000-5000 battles from Chatbot Arena. Employing one or multiple strong LLMs (eg. Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to annotate ground truth labels for each battle. A manual check can be conducted to ensure reasonable accuracy.</li> <li>Optimization: Employ a smaller, open-source model for classification. Remove any COT in the system prompt for additional inference speed up. Verification: Evaluate the smaller classifier against the ground truth labels on the sample battles. We typically iterate until reaching a high precision and recall.</li> <li>Deploy: The best classifier and optimal system prompt are chosen to label the entire Chatbot Arena dataset.</li> </ol> <p>For example, when developing our new creative writing category using the Label Bench framework, we found that with no CoT, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct classified the prompts with 96.1% accuracy (precision: 66.7%, recall: 96.6%) with respect to high-quality labels generated by GPT-4o-mini with CoT. We also cross check this classifier against labels generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet with COT. After ensuring its performance, we deployed this scalable LLM for the final labeling of our 2 million battle prompts.</p> <p>After data labeling, we can compute the Chatbot Arena leaderboard only on the subset of Arena battles labeled as belonging to the category in order to produce a category-specific leaderboard.</p> <h2 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h2> <p>With the groundwork of category creation completed, we can now delve into the meaningful results: statistical trends, categorical correlations, and insights into models‚Äô strengths and weaknesses.</p> <h3 id="categories-over-time">Categories over Time</h3> <p>Are people asking harder questions as LLMs become better? We found the answer is <strong>yes</strong>! The percentage of Hard Prompts, Instruction-Following, Coding, and Math prompts has been increasing since Chatbot Arena‚Äôs launch back in April 2023.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/timeseries.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2: Percentage of Chatbot Arena Battles belonging to each category over time.</p> <p>The data also reveals some interesting seasonal variations in prompt complexity. For example, we observe an increase in the percentage of hard prompts during the school year, when students may be asking difficult homework-related questions.</p> <h3 id="relationships-between-categories">Relationships between categories</h3> <p>One way to assess the relationship between categories is to compare their leaderboards. Similar categories may have similar leaderboards. In this subsection we compare the leaderboards of different categories via their Kendall rank correlations.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/kendall_technical_cluster.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3: Kendall Rank Correlations between Chatbot Arena Leaderboards (Task-specific Categories). Similar leaderboards are clustered together. SC means Style Control.</p> <p>Figure 3 reports the Kendall correlations. First, technical leaderboards (Coding, Math, and Hard Prompt) tend to be more correlated with one another compared with Creative Writing. Secondly, consistent with the fact that it is a mixture of them all, the overall leaderboard is moderately correlated with all categories. The highest-correlation category with the overall leaderboard is Instruction-Following. Finally, it is worth mentioning that all these correlations are relatively high; the differences between categories are on the smaller side, although not insignificant.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/kendall_language_cluster.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4. Kendall Rank Correlations between Chatbot Arena Leaderboards (Language Categories). Similar leaderboards are clustered together. SC means Style Control.</p> <p>Above Figure 4 reports the Kendall correlation between different languages. Latin based languages exhibit higher correlations with one another. Chinese is most highly correlated with Japanese. Korean exhibits weaker correlations with the other languages.</p> <h2 id="model-insights">Model Insights</h2> <p>Now that we‚Äôve examined the broad relationships between categories, let‚Äôs dive deeper into how individual models perform across different tasks. Understanding these performance patterns is crucial for both users and developers, as it reveals the specialized strengths and potential limitations of each model. By analyzing win-rates across categories and comparing models with similar overall performance, we can uncover nuanced insights that might be obscured in the overall leaderboard rankings.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/o1_mini_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5. o1 Mini‚Äôs win-rate conditioned on categories as fitted using a standard decision tree algorithm. Blue indicates o1 Mini wins more often while orange means o1 Mini loses. The selected battles are o1 mini against other models with similar performances (grok-2-2024-08-13, gemini-1.5-pro-002, o1-preview, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, gpt-4o-2024-05-13, chatgpt-4o-latest-20240903).</p> <p>In Figure 5, we observed o1 Mini‚Äôs win-rate conditioned on specific categories, providing a visual map of its strengths and weaknesses. In math and hard prompts, o1 Mini performs significantly better, indicated by the blue half of the decision tree. On the other hand, o1 Mini struggles on creative writing when compared to other models.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/gemini-1.5-pro-2_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6. Gemini-1.5-Pro-002‚Äôs win-rate conditioned on categories as fitted using a standard decision tree algorithm. The selected battles are Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 against top Chatbot Arena models (o1-preview, o1-mini, chatgpt-4o-latest-20240903, claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620, yi-lightning).</p> <p>Unlike o1-mini, Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 demonstrates exceptional performance on creative writing compared to other top models, as illustrated in Figure 6. However, its performance on coding tasks remains a notable weakness.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/yi-lightning_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 7. Yi-Lightning‚Äôs win-rate conditioned on categories as fitted using a standard decision tree algorithm. The selected battles are Yi-Lightning against top Chatbot Arena models (o1-mini, gemini-1.5-pro-002, gpt-4o-2024-05-13, claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620, glm-4-plus).</p> <p>Our analysis of Yi-Lightning, a recent state-of-the-art Chinese LLM, also shows interesting performance patterns. As shown in Figure 7, Yi-Lightning excels at handling complex prompts but shows relatively weaker performance in following basic instructions compared to other top models. Notably, when instruction-following tasks incorporate creative elements, Yi-Lightning‚Äôs performance improves.</p> <h2 id="community-contribution">Community Contribution</h2> <p>Want to see another category on the leaderboard?

Let‚Äôs push the boundaries and make Chatbot Arena the best it can be!</p> <h2 id="acknowledgment">Acknowledgment</h2> <p>We thank <a href="https://fireworks.ai/">Fireworks AI</a> for their fast open model endpoint supports.</p> <h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2> <h3 id="more-category-definitions">More Category Definitions</h3> <p>We now go into detail on other categories and the checklists we used to define them.</p> <h3 id="hard-prompt">Hard Prompt</h3> <p>Hard Prompt category features user-submitted prompts from the Arena that are specifically designed to be more complex, demanding, and rigorous. Carefully curated, these prompts test the capabilities of the latest language models, providing valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses in tackling challenging tasks.</p> <p>What are the important criteria for a prompt to be ‚ÄúHard‚Äù?</p> <ul> <li>Specificity: Being specific, well-defined, and without ambiguity.</li> <li>Domain Knowledge: Tests the AI‚Äôs knowledge and understanding in a specific domain or set of domains.</li> <li>Complexity: Has multiple levels of reasoning, components, or variables.</li> <li>Problem-Solving: Requires active problem-solving: analyzing and clearly defining the problem and systematically devising and implementing a solution.</li> <li>Creativity: Involves a level of creativity when approaching the problem.</li> <li>Technical Accuracy: Requires a high degree of technical accuracy, correctness and precision.</li> <li>Real-world Application: Relates to real-world applications.</li> </ul> <p>For more information, refer to the released blog dedicated to the Hard Prompt category <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/hard-prompts/">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="math">Math</h3> <p>Mathematics evaluation focuses on a model‚Äôs ability to actively apply mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Contrary to prompts that merely seek explanations of mathematical concepts, these prompts require direct mathematical computation or logical deduction.</p> <p>Mathematical Prompts:</p> <ul> <li>Requires active application of mathematical concepts</li> <li>Involves some sorts of numerical calculations or algebraic manipulations or geometrical reasoning</li> <li>Contains clear, well-defined, and objective problems</li> <li>Tests one or multiple mathematical competencies</li> </ul> <p>For example, ‚ÄúExplain what a derivative is‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt qualify as a math prompt, but ‚ÄúFind the derivative of f(x) = x¬≥ + 2x¬≤ - 5x + 3‚Äù would. For more examples, see Appendix <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="instruction-following">Instruction-Following</h3> <p>This category evaluates a model‚Äôs ability to precisely follow given instructions, particularly focusing on multi-step tasks and specific requirements. Similar to the Hard Prompt category‚Äôs emphasis on specificity and technical accuracy, instruction-following prompts zoom in on assessing the AI‚Äôs capability to execute directions with precision and completeness. The category focuses specifically on the model‚Äôs ability to understand and execute detailed instructions rather than on domain knowledge or problem-solving capabilities.</p> <p>Instruction-following prompts include:</p> <ul> <li>Clear, actionable instructions from the user</li> <li>Specific formatting or structural requirements for the response</li> <li>Unique or challenging aspects that would test the AI‚Äôs ability to follow directions precisely</li> </ul> <p>For example, while ‚Äúwrite about dogs‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt qualify as an instruction-following prompt, ‚ÄúWrite a 3-paragraph description of dogs, using exactly 5 adjectives per paragraph, and conclude with a bulleted list of 3 care tips‚Äù would. For more examples, see <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="coding">Coding</h3> <p>The coding category evaluates a model‚Äôs capability to understand, generate, and debug code across different programming languages and paradigms. Unlike the previous categories, we employ a heuristic algorithm to classify coding prompts.</p> <p>Our Coding Classifier looks for:</p> <ul> <li>Code blocks in prompt and responses</li> <li>Programming language names and keywords</li> <li>Code commands and other miscellaneous items</li> </ul> <p>While traditional coding benchmarks target specific tasks (such as code editing or algorithm implementation), Chatbot Arena‚Äôs coding category encompasses all code-related activities. Taking advantage of its open-ended nature, we evaluate models on complex, multi-layered software engineering tasks. For example, a prompt like ‚ÄúHelp me build a professional website using TypeScript‚Äù assesses LLMs not only on code generation but also on broader software development decision-making capabilities. For more examples, see Appendix <a href="#example-prompts">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="languages">Languages</h3> <p>Each language category assesses a model‚Äôs proficiency in responding to prompts within the language. Many Chatbot Arena users engage with LLMs in languages beyond English, testing models on their versatility, linguistic precision, and cultural context in many languages.</p> <p>We tag each prompt with a language tag using <a href="https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Polyglot</a>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/lang_histogram.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 8. Number of Chatbot Arena battles in each of the current set of language categories.</p> <h3 id="style-control">Style Control</h3> <p>Answer style indeed has a strong effect on models‚Äô performance on Chatbot Arena leaderboard. Certain model could be favored because it includes a lot of details when responding or uses heavy markdowns to make its responses appear nicer to human voters. To address this, we develop Style Control as a way to separate the effect of answer style from the content, so you can observe both effects individually.</p> <p>We dedicated an entire blog for style control: please check it out here <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/style-control/">link</a>.</p> <h3 id="others">Others</h3> <p>We also include a number of other categories, many of which are self-explanatory. As a few examples, we include</p> <ul> <li>Exclude Refusal: Excludes all battles where one or more LLM refused to respond. We currently identify refusals via simple keyword matching (eg. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt assist‚Äù).</li> <li>Multi-turn: Conversations with multiple turns.</li> <li>Long queries: Queries longer than 500 tokens (approximately 10% of all prompts).</li> <li>Short queries: Queries shorter than 5 tokens. These queries tend to be trivial (e.g. ‚ÄúHello‚Äù).</li> </ul> <h3 id="additional-model-insights">Additional Model Insights</h3> <p>Below we present strengths and weaknesses decision trees for GPT-4o-mini and Claude-3.5-Sonnet.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/arena_category/gpt-4o-mini_dark.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 9.

These training processes can cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. How can we know whether to trust an LLM judge or reward model, given its critical role in guiding LLM training?</p> <p>We introduce a benchmark to solve this problem: PPE, a collection of 16,038 labeled human preference pairs from Chatbot Arena containing responses from 20 different top LLMs and over 121 languages as well as a dataset of 2,555 prompts, each with 32 different sampled response options, totaling 81,760 responses across 4 different models, all grounded with verifiable correctness labels. PPE evaluates reward models on 12 different metrics and 12 different domains, such as their accuracy in selecting human-preferred or verifiably correct responses.</p> <p>To summarize:</p> <ol> <li>We curate high quality ground truth preference pairs from Chatbot Arena battles as well as existing verifiable correctness benchmarks.</li> <li>We experimentally correlate metrics on each benchmark to downstream RLHF-ed LLMs.</li> <li>We fully open-source PPE, the resulting comprehensive benchmark for reward models with metrics directly linked to downstream RLHF outcomes.</li> </ol> <p>¬†</p> <embed src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/ppe_image.svg" type="image/svg+xml" style="width:100%; height:auto;"/> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 1: Human preference scores on two different metrics use by PPE: Accuracy and Spearman correlation. We notice that the two metrics appear to measure different aspects of the preference proxy. Accuracy may be better for tasks that rank individual responses (like training). Spearman correlation may be better for tasks that rank models (like evaluation). See the later section <i>Studying the Correlation of PPE with Downstream Performance</i> for details on how various metrics correlate to RLHF outcomes. Note: LLM judges in the figure use the Arena-Hard judge prompt.</sub></p> <p>¬†</p> <p>Our code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/lmarena/PPE">Github</a>.</p> <p>Our paper is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14872">Arxiv</a>.</p> <p>¬†</p> <h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1> <p>Sourcing high quality, unbiased ground truth preference labels is challenging. One common technique is to use LLM judge preference labels followed by human verification; however, this introduces bias. Another technique involves creating synthetic data by generating perturbations of a gold-standard output, which again introduces bias. These preference pairs are not representative of the distribution of responses seen by reward models when providing learning signals for RLHF.</p> <p>Our methodology directly grounds preference labels in real user feedback. We propose two methodologies: (1) Utilize crowdsourced diverse prompts and responses with human preference labels from Chatbot Arena. (2) Utilize existing benchmarks with verifiable correctness checks on LLM-generated responses.</p> <p>The first methodology provides an unbiased estimate of real-world human preference by aggregating many diverse human preferences. We use a large crowdsourced preference set of 16,038 preference labels to mitigate individual label noise and avoid over-fitting to any single individual‚Äôs preference.</p> <p>The second methodology curates an objective correctness signal. We use the second approach to label the correctness of many sampled responses from an LLM, mimicking rollouts or best-of-k exploration strategies seen in RLHF training processes. As a result, we draw preference pairs from more naturally occurring distributions (e.g. real LLM responses and errors), that better align with the expected environment reward models operate in.</p> <p>¬†</p> <h1 id="human-preference">Human Preference</h1> <p>To measure whether alignment with human preference directly, we utilize a dataset collected from Chatbot Arena. The human preference dataset contains human-labeled preferences for 16,038 pairwise comparisons between 20 selected top models.</p> <p>Since the human preference set is crowdsourced from Chatbot Arena, we can repeat the collection process at any time to obtain an updated set that better reflects the current array of available models and any changes in human preference.</p> <p>The human preference dataset, at a glance, includes:</p> <ol> <li> <p>4,583 instruction-following prompts, 5,195 hard prompts, 2,564 math prompts. Prompts may exist in multiple categories.</p> </li> <li> <p>User queries from over 121 languages. Top languages include English (8,842), Chinese (1,823), Russian (1,779), German (568), Korean (338), Japanese (321), etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>A diverse array of prompt categories: Hard, Easy, Math, Instruction following, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Preferences crowdsourced from 6,120 individuals.</p> </li> </ol> <p>See Appendix <a href="#human-preference-metrics">Human Preference Metrics</a> for model scores.</p> <p>¬†</p> <h1 id="correctness-preference">Correctness Preference</h1> <p>We measure a preference model‚Äôs ability to distinguish between similar responses and resistance to reward-hacking by using correctness metrics based on benchmarks with verifiable ground truths. We selected five reliable benchmarks: MMLU Pro, MATH, GPQA, MBPP Plus, and IFEval, ensuring that each provides a clear, verifiable correctness signal. This approach is flexible, allowing any benchmark with a verifiable ground truth to be added.</p> <p>In total, the correctness preference set contains:</p> <ol> <li> <p>2,555 prompts and 32 sampled responses per prompt, totaling 81,760 total responses.</p> </li> <li> <p>A binary correctness label for each response.</p> </li> <li> <p>Responses from Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9b-it, Claude-3-Haiku, and GPT-4o-mini.</p> </li> </ol> <p>See Appendix <a href="#correctness-preference-metrics">Correctness Preference Metrics</a> for model scores.</p> <p>¬†</p> <h1 id="validating-post-rlhf-llm-outcomes">Validating post-RLHF LLM outcomes</h1> <p>We aim to see how well PPE predict the performance of reward models in training LLMs. To do this, we RLHF-tune a base LLM using several reward models and evaluate the resulting LLMs by measuring real-world human preference (Arena Scores). The experiment uses Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, with RLHF via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Results are collected from 12,190 human votes in Chatbot Arena, and final Arena Scores depend solely on the reward model used.</p> <p>We selected nine reward models based on popularity and performance. We built a dataset of 8,000 prompts and 128,000 model responses collected from the base model from which each reward model picked a preferred response per prompt, creating a training set of ‚Äúchosen‚Äù and ‚Äúrejected‚Äù responses. Using DPO, we trained Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for each reward model to assess downstream real-world human preference.</p> <p>We deployed our trained DPO models to Chatbot Arena for real-world human evaluation. These models were paired against each other for blind comparison. A total of 12,190 votes were collected, averaging 2,032 battles per model and 190 battles per unique model pair. The resulting Arena Scores, calculated using the Bradley-Terry model, are detailed in Appendix <a href="#post-rlhf-arena-scores">Post-RLHF Arena Scores</a>, highlighting the downstream RLHF performance of each reward model based on human preferences.</p> <h1 id="studying-the-correlation-of-ppe-with-downstream-performance">Studying the Correlation of PPE with Downstream Performance</h1> <p><a id="figure2"></a> <img src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/MainHeatmaps.png" style="width:100%; height:auto; text-align: center;"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 2: Pearson correlations of different metrics toward downstream human preference. Left: Pearson correlation between the ranking of models on 5 specific benchmarks and 5 different metrics and their respective post-DPO Arena Score rankings on real human preference. Right: Pearson correlation between the ranking of models on 7 categories and 7 metrics on the Human Preference Dataset.</sub></p> <p><a id="figure3"></a> <img src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/RewardBenchHeatmap.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%; height: auto;"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 3: Pearson correlation between the ranking of models in RewardBench and their respective post-DPO Arena Score rankings on real human preference.</sub></p> <p>On correctness metrics (left plot in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>) we make several observations: (1) Mean across all domains is well correlated across all metrics, but exhibits higher correlation with AUC and Accuracy scores. (2) Math is the best individual benchmark domain in terms of predictive power. (3) ROC AUC score draws higher correlation across all benchmarks, even on benchmarks that are otherwise uncorrelated.</p> <p>Turning to the right-hand side of <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>, the accuracy of the reward model is the best predictor of the fine-tuned LLM‚Äôs preference score. Row-wise Pearson Correlation, Confidence Agreement, and Separability show some correlative power to downstream scores but do not exceed accuracy. Meanwhile, metrics like the Spearman correlation and Kendall correlation have nearly zero correlation with the final Arena Scores achieved by the post-DPO models. One possible reason for this trend is that accuracy measures expected preference correctness per preference pair‚Äî a much more granular scale. Other metrics involve aggregating reward model signals over higher-order preferences, such as preference for each model, as measured by correlation metrics. We consider these metrics as low granularity. Medium granularity metrics, such as Row-wise Pearson Correlation aggregate reward model signal, but do so over smaller subsets of preferences.</p> <p>Overall, accuracy on the human preference dataset is more correlated than the correctness metrics. This is because correctness and human preference do not necessarily align. Moreover, the information contained in Loss, Max score, and End score may not prove relevant in DPO, which is off-policy. Those employing RLHF algorithms that have a higher risk of over-optimization may find these alternative measures helpful. However, when calculating correlation against style controlled Arena Scores<sup>*</sup> we notice a slight decrease in correlations on the human preference dataset. Notably, the correctness preference measurements show no change, suggesting correctness preference may be more robust towards reward model preference quality, response style aside. Style-controlled correlation heatmaps are shown in Appendix <a href="#style-control">Style Control</a>.</p> <p><sup>*</sup> Style controlled Arena Scores are calculated as detailed in our previous blog, <a href="/blog/2024/style-control/"><em>Does Style Matter?</em></a></p> <p>¬† <a id="figure4"></a> <img src="/assets/img/blog/preference_proxy_evaluations/AggregationPlots.png" style="width:100%; height:auto"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;"><sub>Figure 4: Spearman Correlation, Confidence Agreement, and Accuracy metrics: For each metric, we take the quantiles of category scores (Hard, Easy, Instruction Following, Coding, Math, and Similar). The Pearson Correlation is calculated relative to Post-RLHF Human Preference Arena Score ratings for each quantile. Notably, accuracy peaks at 0.80 correlation at low quantile aggregation.</sub></p> <p>¬†</p> <p>Additionally, we observe that measuring the lower bound score may correlate more to downstream RLHF performance than the average score or upper bound score. In <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>, we first re-scale each category‚Äôs scores to be mean 0 and SD 1, then we vary the quantile of the aggregation strategy across human preference dataset categories (Hard Prompts, Easy Prompts, etc). In this case, the 0 quantile is the minimum, and the 1 quantile is the maximum. We find that in nearly every metric, decreasing the quantile increases correlation with downstream Arena Scores. We posit this represents the requirement that reward models be robust under all input distributions to mitigate reward-hacking. Any domain weakness in a reward model can be exploited by the LLM during training.</p> <p>¬†</p> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <p>PPE is another step towards rigorous evaluations of reward models and LLM-Judges before deployment to expensive model training and evaluation pipelines. For reward models specifically, we take extra care to ensure that PPE correlates to downstream RLHF-ed LLM performance. Moreover, PPE is a natural framework in which to evaluate LLM judges. We reasoned that a well-aligned LLM judge should be able to reconstruct the preferences we have sourced with high fidelity. For example, LLM judges used for automatic evaluation should be able to rank models in the human preference set with high confidence and correlation. LLM judges used to replicate individual human preferences should do so at high accuracy, just like reward models. Moving forward, we seek to keep creating, updating, and finding new ways in which to ensure that our preference proxy signals are in alignment with our desired outcomes.</p> <p>¬†</p> <h1 id="citation">Citation</h1> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@misc{frick2024evaluaterewardmodelsrlhf,

We take the view that LLM agents consist of three components - LLM models (e.g GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.1), frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, etc), and tools (code interpreters, APIs like Brave Search or Yahoo Finance). For example, an agent to summarize an earnings report, might be powered by a GPT-4o model, use PDFReader as tool to read pdf of earnings reports, and be orchestrated by langchain! Agent-arena captures and ranks user-preferences for agents as a unit, and for each of the three sub-components, providing insights to model-developers, tool-developers, and more critically, users of LLM agents!</p> <p>Agents come with many nuances in model and framework evaluation. For example, let‚Äôs say I wanted to build a financial assistant that retrieves the top performing stocks of the week.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>‚ùìWhat model should I use?</strong> One model have been trained on far more financial data üí∏, while another may excel in reasoning ‚ôüÔ∏è and computation ‚ûó.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>‚ùì And what about frameworks?</strong> One platform might have more API integrations but another might index the internet better.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>‚ùì What tools should I use?</strong> Do I need tools that return stock prices üìà or APIs that can return news üì∞ about the market for this specific use-case.</p> </blockquote> <p>As this example illustrates, there is much to think about when designing an agentic workflow - and this is only one use-case out of potentially dozens in the financial domain alone. Different use-cases will call for different combinations of models, tools, and frameworks.</p> <p>We are delighted to release <strong>ü§ñ Agent Arena</strong>, an interactive sandbox where users can compare, visualize, and rate agentic workflows <strong>personalized to their needs</strong>. Agent Arena allows users to choose from a combinations of tasks, LLM providers, frameworks, tools, etc and also vote on their performance. We enable users to see how different agents perform against each other in a structured and systematic way. By doing this, we believe that users can make more informed decisions regarding their <em>agentic stack</em>. Further, with the Agent Arena we wish to showcase the shortcomings and impressive advacements of the state of agents!</p> <p>Agent Arena also consists of live leaderboard and ranking of LLM models, frameworks, and tools grouped by domain. Additionally, we believe these rankings can help inform model, tooling, and framework developers, helping them understand where they stand on various use-cases and how they can improve. Also recognizing that user-vote based elections are affected by selection-bias, as a new feature, Agent Arena also includes a Prompt Hub, where you can subscribe to specific prompt-experts and see their invidual opinions on various tasks. <strong>You</strong> can also publish your set of prompts!</p> <p>This blog post will look into the key elements of Agent Arena, including the definition of agents, the novel ranking algorithm, model tuning, examples of agent use cases, and a roadmap for future developments. And saving the best for the last, along with this blog, we are also releasing 2,000 real-world, pair-wise agent battles, and user preferences!! We‚Äôll continue to periodically release more battle data!</p> <p><strong>Quick Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Arena:</strong> <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/">Agent-Arena</a></li> <li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/leaderboard">Agent Leaderboard</a></li> <li><strong>User Prompts:</strong> <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/users">Prompt Hub</a></li> <li><strong>Agent Battle Data:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/blob/main/agent-arena/evalutation/agent_ratings_V0.json">Agent Battle Data</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="-what-are-agents">ü¶ú What are Agents?</h2> <p>In Agent Arena, agents are defined as entities that can perform complex tasks by leveraging various subcomponents. We define each agent to be made up to three components - LLM models, tools, and frameworks. The agents we consider are sourced from established frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, Composio, and assistants provided by OpenAI and Anthropic. Each of these agents may display characteristics such as chain-of-thought reasoning, tool use, and function calling, which enable them to execute complex tasks efficiently. For the platform, we utilized models that support function calling and tool use, which are critical aspects for LLM agents.</p> <p><em>LLM agents leverage various tools like code interpreters and external APIs to enhance their problem-solving abilities and execute complex tasks efficiently</em></p> <p>For example, LangChain and LlamaIndex agents come equipped with specific toolkits that enhance their problem-solving capabilities. OpenAI‚Äôs assistants, such as code interpreters and file processing models, also qualify as agents due to their demonstrated ability to interpret code, process files, and call external functions. Anthropic‚Äôs agents are integrated with external tools, and similar examples from other frameworks further enhance their utility for specific tasks.</p> <h2 id="the-agent-arena-platform">The Agent Arena Platform</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_agent_arena_flowchart.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 2: A high-level overview of agent comparisons based on user goals, models, frameworks, and performance metrics like execution time and ELO</p> <p>At its core, Agent Arena allows for goal-based agent comparisons. On a high level, users will first input a task that they want to accomplish. Then, an LLM automatically assign relevant agents based on the task. These agents are then tasked with completing the goal, with the agent‚Äôs actions and <em>chain of thought</em> being streamed to the user in real-time. Once the agents have completed the task, the user can compare the outputs side-by-side and vote on which agent performed better.</p> <p>The evaluation process includes voting on agent performance, with users assessing which agent met the task‚Äôs requirements more effectively. This user-driven evaluation contributes to an evolving leaderboard system, which ranks agents based on their relative performance across multiple tasks and competitions. This comparison is not limited to the agents as a whole but extends to the individual components (i.e., LLM models, tools, and frameworks) that comprise each agent.</p> <p>In the sections below, we will look into the core components of Agent Arena, including the router system, execution, evaluation and ranking mechanisms, leaderboard, and prompt hub. We will also explore some example tasks and applications that can be performed on the platform.</p> <h2 id="the-router-system-agent-matching-and-task-assignment">The Router System: Agent Matching and Task Assignment</h2> <p>A central element of Agent Arena is its router system, which is powered by GPT-4o currently. We plan to cycle between all models, and also judge each model‚Äôs ability to route prompts to the most relevant agents! The router‚Äôs primary function is to match users‚Äô specified goals with the most suitable agents available on the platform.</p> <p>The router operates by analyzing the user‚Äôs input (the goal or task) and selects two agents that are optimally suited to complete that task. This selection process factors in the agents‚Äô historical performance across similar tasks, as well as their configurations in terms of models, tools, and frameworks.</p> <p>For example, a user might provide the following: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">input("Tell me about whats going on in NVIDIA in the last week.")</code> The router would then select two suitable options given the available agents and the leaderboard ELOs. For this use-case, the router might select the agent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">agent_a = Agent(model="GPT-4o", tools=["Yahoo Finance", "Matplotlib"], framework="Langchain")</code> to analyze the stock information about NVIDIA. On the other side, to compare against Agent A, the router might select the combination: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">agent_b = Agent(model="Claude", tools=["Yahoo News"], framework="CrewAI")</code> to observe the goal from the perspective of news.</p> <p>This comparison is fruitful because it allows the platform and the user to understand the nuances in the agents‚Äô capabilities and the different ways they can approach the same task. Then, they themselves can vote for which style they like better.</p> <h2 id="evaluation-and-ranking-system">Evaluation and Ranking System</h2> <p>Agent Arena employs a comprehensive ranking system that evaluates agents based on their performance in head-to-head comparisons. The leaderboard ranks agents not only based on their overall performance but also by breaking down the performance of individual components such as LLM models, tools, and frameworks. The ranking process is informed by both user evaluations and an ELO-based rating system, commonly used in competitive ranking environments, where agent performance is dynamically adjusted after each task or comparison.</p> <p>The rating system in Agent Arena is designed to reflect the cumulative performance of agents across a wide range of tasks, taking into account factors such as:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_leaderboard1.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 3: The leaderboards analyzing the subcomponents of the agents</p> <ul> <li><strong>Model performance:</strong> Evaluating the effectiveness of the underlying LLM models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.1).</li> <li><strong>Tool efficiency:</strong> Ranking the tools agents use to complete tasks (e.g., code interpreters, APIs like Brave Search or Yahoo Finance).</li> <li><strong>Framework functionality:</strong> Assessing the broader frameworks that support agents, such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI.</li> </ul> <p>Check out the latest rankings for each category on our leaderboard: <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/leaderboard">Agent Arena Leaderboard</a>.</p> <h3 id="Ô∏è-evaluating-agents-with-the-extended-arena-score">‚öñÔ∏è Evaluating Agents with the Extended Arena Score</h3> <p>Agent Arena uses the <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/extended-arena/">extended Arena score</a>, which allows us to compare different agents based on their subcomponents, including tools, models, and frameworks. Instead of just evaluating the agents atomically, we also assess the performance of each individual subcomponent. This allows us to more accurately pinpoint where an agent‚Äôs strength lies. For example, our first agent could be a combination of LangChain, Brave-Search, and GPT-4o-2024-08-06, while the second agent could be LlamaIndex, Wikipedia, and Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20240620.</p> <p>Therefore, we propose the following observation model for the Extended Arena Score. Given <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P_1</code>,</p> <p>For each battle \(i \in [n]\), we have a prompt and two agents, encoded as the following:</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent A</code>: The first agent being compared with an elo of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E_A</code> and with the subcomponents <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(A_T, A_M, A_F)</code></li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent B</code>: The second agent being compared, having an elo of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E_B</code> and with the subcomponents <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(B_T, B_M, B_F)</code></li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y_i</code>: Outcome of the battle (1 for win, 0 for loss)</li> </ul> <h4 id="-example-langchain-brave-search-agent-vs-llamaindex-wikipedia-agent">üßë‚Äçüíª Example: LangChain Brave-Search Agent vs. LlamaIndex Wikipedia Agent</h4> <p>Let‚Äôs walk through an example to illustrate how the Extended Bradley-Terry Model works in practice. Take the following agents and their subcomponents:</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent_A</code> is the LangChain Brave-Search Agent, using the following subcomponents: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ Brave-Search (A_T), LangChain (A_F), and GPT-4o-2024-08-06 (A_M) }</code> and an Elo of 1600.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent B</code> is the LlamaIndex Wikipedia Agent, with the subcomponents: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{Wikipedia (B_T), LlamaIndex (B_F), and Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20240620 (B_M)}</code> and an Elo of 1500.</li> </ul> <p>To get a holistic evaluation of an agent, we combine all its subcomponents into a single analysis. Instead of treating each subcomponent as an isolated entity, we consider their interaction within the broader agent architecture. For each battle, we build a design matrix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> that represents all the subcomponents involved. This allows us to evaluate the collective contribution of the subcomponents (tools, models, frameworks) in a single calculation. We then apply logistic regression with L2 regularization to control for overfitting and confounding effects caused by frequent pairings. By using this combined approach, Agent Arena ensures more accurate rankings across agents and their subcomponents. üîÑ This method provides clearer insights into each agent‚Äôs performance and contributions, preventing the bias that can occur from frequent pairings or overused configurations. See the <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/extended-arena/">blog</a> for additional mathematical details!</p> <p>üéâ As a result, our system generates a real-time, continuously updating leaderboard that not only reflects the agents‚Äô overall performance but also their specific subcomponent strengths. üèÜ Check out our live leaderboards for agents, tools, models, and frameworks <a href="https://www.agent-arena.com/leaderboard">here</a>!</p> <h2 id="the-prompt-hub">The Prompt Hub</h2> <p>The Agent Arena also comes with a prompt hub that has over 1000+ tasks that have been tested and verified to work on the platform. Users will be able to search for similar use cases as theirs and observe how different prompts are executed and perform. Furthermore, the platform also enables users to post their prompts to the community. This public view of prompts that are being evaluates through agent arena provides strong infrastructure and data for future anayltics for future agent development and evaluation.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_prompthub.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 4: The prompt hub featuring registered users in the arena</p> <h3 id="-prompt-hub-overview">üè† Prompt Hub Overview</h3> <p>The prompt hub is a way for users to interact with other users and see a unique view of the individual and domain specific use cases that users demand with agents. This is a great way to see user activity at a granular level and see what specifically users are using agents to do and how to prioritize future agent development.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_prompthub_example_v2.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 5: View, like, and dislike individual user prompts</p> <h3 id="-individual-user-view">üßë‚Äçüíª Individual User View</h3> <p>Additionaly, users can provide feedback to other users on their individual prompts through the prompt hub by liking and disliking individual prompts. This provides an additional data point for future for prompt analytics to potentially evaluate domain-specific performance of various agents in the arena.</p> <h2 id="-case-studies">üíº Case Studies</h2> <p>Your choice of model, framework, and tools will often differ greatly depending on domain applications and use cases. Domain-specific agent developer will need to find the optimal combination of these factors to maximize performance. The vision of the future is that eventually, agents will become accurate enough to the point where we will allow them to make informed and perhaps critical decisions without the need for a human in the loop. While there‚Äôs ways to go, here are a few industries that could get shaken up by agents:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/blog/agent-arena/blog_post_14_example_run.png" style="display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 90%"/></p> <p style="color:gray; text-align: center;">Figure 6: Example flow of LLM agents providing projections and insights on GE stock prices based on relevant earnings and competitors</p> <h3 id="real-world-agent-workflows-interesting-user-scenarios">Real-World Agent Workflows: Interesting User Scenarios</h3> <p>In the following section, we showcase some of the most interesting real-world examples from the Agent Arena.

</pre> </details> <p>In education-focused scenarios, LLM agents have the potential to offer rich, step-by-step explanations that guide students through complex problems, such as physics calculations. In the example of determining how long it takes for a 5 kg object to fall from 10 meters, the agents approached the problem using basic equations of motion. However, while Agent A (anthropic calculator tool, claude-3-opus-20240229) provided a thorough breakdown of the solution, the simplicity of its approach highlighted a need for more nuanced handling of kinematics, such as adaptive responses that dynamically adjust based on user queries. Meanwhile, Agent B (langchain Wolfram Alpha, claude-3-haiku-20240307) leveraged Wolfram Alpha but struggled with obtaining relevant data from the tool, indicating gaps in API integration that hinder real-time computational accuracy. These cases show opportunities for fine-tuning the agents‚Äô interaction with APIs and frameworks, ensuring that agents not only retrieve correct data but also process and apply it efficiently to real-world scenarios. Improving the fluidity and depth of these calculations, especially when leveraging multiple APIs, can bring enhanced precision and adaptability in educational contexts, enriching the learning experience and making the agent more capable of handling varied educational queries.</p> <h4 id="business-data-analytics-">Business Data Analytics üí∏</h4> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúGiven this .csv file of last year‚Äôs sales data, generate insights of what products to scale up.‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <details> <summary>Prompt Execution</summary> <pre>

</pre> </details> <p>In business data analytics, LLM agents can offer valuable insights by processing large datasets, such as CSV files containing sales data, to uncover trends and make strategic recommendations. In this example, Agent A (sql agent plotter langchain, gpt-4o-2024-05-13) struggled with an error, misinterpreting the CSV file as a SQLite database, which highlights limitations in the agent‚Äôs error-handling capabilities and its adaptability to different file formats. Although the agent attempted to switch tools and correct the process, it was clear that a more seamless integration between SQL and file-processing tools was needed to maintain workflow fluidity. Meanwhile, Agent B (langchain Pandas DataFrame, gpt-4o-2024-08-06) effectively analyzed the sales data, identifying top-performing products like ‚ÄúLaptop‚Äù and ‚ÄúSmartphone‚Äù based on sales revenue, and suggested scaling up ‚ÄúHeadphones‚Äù and ‚ÄúKeyboard‚Äù due to high sales volume. However, Agent B could benefit from deeper contextual understanding by linking sales patterns with external factors such as seasonality or promotions. These examples underscore the need for agents to better handle complex datasets, enhance error resilience, and offer more context-aware analysis, especially when switching between tools or working with diverse data formats. Improving these areas would significantly enhance the agent‚Äôs ability to deliver more robust, actionable insights, particularly in complex business scenarios.</p> <h4 id="social-media-management--content-creation-">Social Media Management / Content Creation üì∏</h4> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúSchedule daily Instagram posts for a week, promoting our upcoming sale using relevant hashtags and current influencer trends.‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <details> <summary>Prompt Execution</summary> <pre>

As a result, it has been increasingly used, especially in cases of refractory headache pain. Headaches can be classified as primary and secondary and can result from a variety of serious conditions. Types of primary headaches include tension, migraine, and cluster headaches whereas secondary headaches include headaches because of infection or vascular disease, and cervicogenic headaches. Both types can result in serious debility and diminished quality of life. The treatment of chronic headache pain commonly consists of lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and injectable medications. The aim of this study was to investigate the primary and secondary outcomes of RFA for chronic headache pain.METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using three different databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database. The key concepts of \"radiofrequency ablation\" and \"headache\" were used. The search took place in June 2023, and it included articles from the past twenty years.RESULTS: Of the 580 articles found, 32 were included in the review. Most studies focused on pain scores, duration of relief, function, and patient satisfaction. In several studies, RFA was used to target various nerves as the pain generator and compared with modalities such as local anesthetic or corticosteroid.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, RFA shows favorable outcomes in the management of chronic headache pain. Therefore, RFA can serve as an alternative treatment option for patients who fail other conservative treatment regimens. Understanding the outcomes of RFA for headache pain can provide patients and clinicians with evidence for the most appropriate treatment strategies.Published: 2024-06-03Title: New Daily PersistentThought:I have gathered information on two recent studies regarding treatment options for chronic migraines. The first study focuses on the efficacy and safety of erenumab, a preventive therapy for chronic migraine and medication overuse headaches. The second study reviews the use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a treatment for chronic headache pain, indicating it may be a viable option for patients who do not respond to conventional treatments.Final Answer: Recent research suggests that erenumab (administered monthly) is effective for chronic migraines, particularly in patients with medication overuse headaches. Additionally, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is emerging as a promising alternative treatment for chronic headache pain, especially for those who have not found relief with other therapies.&gt; Recent research suggests that erenumab (administered monthly) is effective for chronic migraines, particularly in patients with medication overuse headaches.

Action: pub_medAction Input: \"chronic migraine treatment options 2023 review\"Too Many Requests, waiting for 0.80 seconds...Observation: Published: 2024-07-08Title: Radiofrequency ablation for headache pain: an updated systematic review.Copyright Information: Summary::BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has many treatment capabilities, one of which includes long term management of chronic headache. As a result, it has been increasingly used, especially in cases of refractory headache pain. Headaches can be classified as primary and secondary and can result from a variety of serious conditions. Types of primary headaches include tension, migraine, and cluster headaches whereas secondary headaches include headaches because of infection or vascular disease, and cervicogenic headaches. Both types can result in serious debility and diminished quality of life. The treatment of chronic headache pain commonly consists of lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and injectable medications. The aim of this study was to investigate the primary and secondary outcomes of RFA for chronic headache pain.METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using three different databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database. The key concepts of \"radiofrequency ablation\" and \"headache\" were used. The search took place in June 2023, and it included articles from the past twenty years.RESULTS: Of the 580 articles found, 32 were included in the review. Most studies focused on pain scores, duration of relief, function, and patient satisfaction. In several studies, RFA was used to target various nerves as the pain generator and compared with modalities such as local anesthetic or corticosteroid.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, RFA shows favorable outcomes in the management of chronic headache pain. Therefore, RFA can serve as an alternative treatment option for patients who fail other conservative treatment regimens. Understanding the outcomes of RFA for headache pain can provide patients and clinicians with evidence for the most appropriate treatment strategies.Published: 2024-06-03Title: New Daily PersistentThought:I have gathered information on two recent studies regarding treatment options for chronic migraines. The first study focuses on the efficacy and safety of erenumab, a preventive therapy for chronic migraine and medication overuse headaches. The second study reviews the use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a treatment for chronic headache pain, indicating it may be a viable option for patients who do not respond to conventional treatments.Final Answer: Recent research suggests that erenumab (administered monthly) is effective for chronic migraines, particularly in patients with medication overuse headaches. Additionally, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is emerging as a promising alternative treatment for chronic headache pain, especially for those who have not found relief with other therapies.&gt; Recent research suggests that erenumab (administered monthly) is effective for chronic migraines, particularly in patients with medication overuse headaches.

</pre> </details> <p>Manually sifting through medical research is not only time-consuming but also leaves room for oversight, particularly when the data spans numerous clinical trials and evolving treatment protocols. LLM agents offer a powerful alternative, adept at combing through extensive medical databases, pulling relevant findings, and connecting them to specific patient conditions. In cases like chronic migraines, an agent can swiftly gather recent studies on effective treatments, such as erenumab, a preventive therapy, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which offers long-term relief for headache pain. For example, in this instance, the langchain PubMed Biomedical Literature Tool (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) agent successfully retrieved relevant research, presenting concrete treatment options based on the latest findings. In contrast, the ArXiv Article Fetcher (claude-3-haiku-20240307) struggled due to ArXiv‚Äôs focus on pre-prints, not clinical treatments. Despite this, the fallback recommendations to check more appropriate medical journals like JAMA show how agents can adapt when limitations arise. Enhancing integration with specialized databases and refining multi-step query handling could unlock even more potential, allowing these agents to provide faster, more accurate, and contextually relevant medical recommendations, ultimately pushing the boundaries of how automated systems can support healthcare decisions.</p> <h4 id="sports-data-analytics-">Sports Data Analytics üèÄ</h4> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúPredict the odds of the Denver Nuggets winning the NBA championship, given individual player statistics, team performance trends, and recent trade news.‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <details> <summary>Prompt Execution</summary> <pre>

</pre> </details> <p>In travel planning, LLM agents have the potential to craft detailed itineraries by optimizing routes and suggesting relevant stops along the way. In the example of planning a day trip from San Francisco to Carmel-by-the-Sea, Agent A (crewai AI Crew for Trip Planning, gemini-1.5-pro-002) and Agent B (langchain google-serper search agent, open-mixtral-8x22b) both suggested fuel-efficient routes and popular attractions. However, while Agent B efficiently identified major landmarks and provided a clear route, the responses lacked dynamic adjustments based on real-time conditions like traffic or road closures.</p> <p>Additionally, Agent A struggled with more seamless transitions between tools, which affected the ability to fully integrate relevant trip data. These examples point to areas where enhancing real-time API integration and improving the agents‚Äô adaptability to changing travel conditions could provide more tailored and accurate trip plans. Better handling of dynamic factors like current road conditions or user-specific preferences would result in richer, more relevant travel experiences.</p> <h2 id="next-steps-and-project-roadmap">Next Steps and Project Roadmap</h2> <p>We have an exciting roadmap ahead for Agent Arena, with several initiatives planned to both enhance and expand the platform‚Äôs capabilities. We envision that the agent arena will become a central hub for both agent developers and providers.</p> <p>For developers and users interested in building/using agents, the platform will be a sandbox for them to perfect their agentic stack, with the right providers and frameworks tailored to their use-cases</p> <p>By providing a systematic way to run agents, compare them against each other, view advanced analytics for providers based on their use-case, and even view the prompts of similar users, we hope to deliver value to the agent-building community.</p> <p>To reach this vision, we have laid out a comprehensive roadmap of feature development and improvement. The general theme of these changes will be to improve the personalization of the arena to individual users along with expanding the available analytics.</p> <h3 id="-increasing-the-number-of-llm--framework-providers-on-the-platform">üìà Increasing the Number of LLM &amp; Framework Providers on the Platform</h3> <p>One of the primary goals of the Agent Arena is to show users all of the combinations of agents that they can build, so they can definitely know which options are the best suited for their use-cases. While we currently offer the main providers in each category, we hope to expand our selection to include more niche providers that are specialized in certain tasks.</p> <h3 id="-incorporating-user-personalization">üßë‚Äçüíª Incorporating User Personalization</h3> <p>In order to make the platform as useful as possible, we want to ensure that users are met with specific recommendations on the latest releases and agents that are best suited for their use-cases. This will involve us learning their preferences in their providers and output formats, enabling us to then recommend the best agents for them.</p> <h3 id="-enabling-multi-turn-prompts">ü™ú Enabling multi-turn prompts</h3> <p>Most agentic tasks involve multiple steps of reasoning and action from the agent. This requires keeping track of the state of the context of the task. For example, take the following task:</p> <blockquote> <p>Task: ‚ÄúSearch for the top 5 performing stocks this year in the S&amp;P 500 and then find the latest news about them.‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <p>This task requires the agent to first find the top 5 stocks, keep it somewhere in backend ‚Äòmemory‚Äô,and then call another set of individual tools to find the latest news about them. This is a multi-turn prompt, and other examples can start to involve 5+ steps. We plan on releasing this feature in the upcoming few months for users.</p> <h3 id="Ô∏èÔ∏è-expanding-the-capabilities-of-the-platform">üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Expanding the Capabilities of the Platform</h3> <p>The current implementation of the platform has left several domains of agent use-cases unexplored. More specifically, we hope to start integrating with APIs like Jira, Github, GSuite and other tools to enable users to actually run agents on their personal data. While this will involve a lot of security and privacy considerations, we believe this is a critical step in making the platform more useful to users.</p> <h3 id="-improving-the-recommendation-algorithm">üìä Improving the Recommendation Algorithm</h3> <p>Based on user preferences and the providers/frameworks they like, we plan on improving the routing of goals to more relevant agents for the user. Additionally, we will include two different modes of routing: one that is more exploratory and one that is more focused on the user‚Äôs preferences.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Agent Arena is a platform to evaluate and compare LLM agents. By offering a comprehensive ranking system and tools to test agents from various frameworks, the platform allows users to make informed decisions about the best models and tools for their specific needs. With continuous improvements and expansions planned, Agent Arena is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of LLM agent evaluation.</p> <p>We invite researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts to explore Agent Arena, contribute to its growth, and help shape the future of agent-based AI systems. Together, we can push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible with LLM agents and unlock new potentials in AI-driven problem-solving.</p> <h2 id="citation">Citation</h2> <p>We hope you enjoyed this blog post.
